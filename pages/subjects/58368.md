<p>The J. Binney in the list of signatures of subscribers is probably the John Binney listed in the 1838 Catalogue of proprietors without a lot number. There are two John Binneys buried at Mount Auburn who could be the subscriber though it is more likely to be the John Binney buried in Lot 681 since he died in 1841</p>
