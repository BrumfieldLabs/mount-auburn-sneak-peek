<p>(March 8, 1804 – August 19, 1887), born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the descendant of a Cape Cod whaling family of English ancestry, was an American astronomer and telescope maker. He started as a portrait painter and engraver (c.1830s-1850s), and at the age of 40 became involved in telescope making. Alvan Clark &amp; Sons was an American maker of optics that became famous for crafting lenses for some of the largest refracting telescopes of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Founded in 1846 in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, by Alvan Clark and his sons George Bassett Clark (1827–1891) and Alvan Graham Clark (1832–1897). Five times, the firm built the largest refracting telescopes in the world including the Great Refactor at the Harvard Observatory just down the road from Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>
