<p>The United States Exploring Expedition of 1838â€“1842 was an exploring and surveying expedition of the Pacific Ocean and surrounding lands conducted by the United States. During the event, armed conflict between Pacific islanders and the expedition was common and dozens of natives were killed in action, as well as a few Americans. A cenotaph at Mount Auburn, the Naval Monument, was erected to commemorate the members of the expedition that died in 1839 and 1840. Lot 899.</p>
