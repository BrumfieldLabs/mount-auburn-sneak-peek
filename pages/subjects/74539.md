<p>The Boston Fatherless and Widows’ Society was established in 1817, and incorporated in 1837. Its mission was for the relief of poor Protestant widows and single women, especially those who have seen better days. Preference was given to American women, and friendly visits were made monthly by a board of 12 ladies who distributed relief. The amount given to each beneficiary depended upon the judgment of the visitor.</p>
