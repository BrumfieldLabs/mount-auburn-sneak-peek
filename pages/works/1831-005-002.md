<p>At a meeting of the Trustees of Mount Auburn Ceme<span class='line-break'></span>tery, holden. <date when='1854-09-04'>Sept. 4. 1854</date>. it was</p>
<p><b>Voted.</b> That the sum of fifteen thousand dollars be appro<span class='line-break'></span>priated for the purchase of three marble statues, to be prepar<span class='line-break'></span>ed and executed under contracts to be made with proper ar<span class='line-break'></span>tists, said statues to be those of persons distinguished in<span class='line-break'> </span>American History. But this vote is subject to the follow<span class='line-break'></span>ing conditions viz: <ins>first</ins>. that it shall be approved in writ<span class='line-break'></span>ing by five at least of this board of trustees; and <ins>second</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>that the professional opinions of <a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>C. P. Curtis Esq<sup>r</sup>.</a> and the<span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary on the subject of the legality of this appropria<span class='line-break'></span>tion by this board shall be taken in writing and found<span class='line-break'> </span>to sustain the legality of such appropriation<span class='line-break'> </span>Attest. <a href='/pages/subjects/62332' title='Parker, Henry Melville'>Henry M. Parker</a>. Secretary.</p>
<p><b> _ Opinion. _ </b></p>
<p>The subject thus submitted to us involves two dis<span class='line-break'></span>tinct questions; <ins>first,</ins> whether the appropriation be in<span class='line-break'> </span>itself legal, and <ins>second,</ins> whether if legal the <ins>Trustees</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>are authorized to make the appropriation</p>
<p>There seems to be no room for doubt as to<span class='line-break'> </span>the second question. By section 4<sup>th</sup> of the Charter<span class='line-break'> </span>of this Corporation it is provided that "the said<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees shall have the general management, superin<span class='line-break'></span>tendence and care of the property <ins>expenditures</ins> business<span class='line-break'> </span>and <ins>prudential</ins> <ins>concerns</ins> of the Corporation, and of <span class='line-break'> </span>the sales of the lots in said Cemetery, and they shall<span class='line-break'> </span>make a <ins>report</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>their doings</ins> to the Corporation at their<span class='line-break'> </span>annual meeting."

<p>erly applied to the purchase of Statuary, - these words are<span class='line-break'> </span>large enough to show that the Board of Trustees is. the<span class='line-break'> </span>proper body to make the appropriation, and contract <span class='line-break'> </span>for the statues.  <ins>Can</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>funds</ins> <ins>be</ins> <ins>properly</ins> <ins>so</ins> <ins>applied</ins>?</p>
<p>The present Corporation took the conveyance of <span class='line-break'> </span>the "Garden and Cemetery" not as an ordinary purchase <span class='line-break'> </span>of land by a Corporation for the purpose of establish<span class='line-break'></span>ing a Cemetery, but upon sundry special trusts, <span class='line-break'> </span>which limit and restrain the full liberty of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation in the use of the property and its proceeds.<span class='line-break'> </span>These trusts are set forth in the tenth section of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Charter, and to that section our remarks will be <span class='line-break'> </span>principally confined;  but some additional light may <span class='line-break'> </span>be derived in the interpretation of it from a part of <span class='line-break'> </span>sections  two and six.  From these it appears that <span class='line-break'> </span>the "Proprietors" hold the land (ยง2.) "upon the same <span class='line-break'> </span>trusts, and for the same purposes as the said <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'>Massa<span class='line-break'></span>chusetts Horticultural Society</a> held the same"  by virtue<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Statute of 1831.  Chapt. 69; and (ยง6) "all the <span class='line-break'> </span>rights, powers and authorities, trusts, immunities and <span class='line-break'> </span>privileges conferred upon the said <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'><!--Mass Hort-->Society</a>" by said act <span class='line-break'> </span>were to be "transferred to and exercised by "the new<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation.  These provisions are important, because <span class='line-break'> </span>the <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'>Mass. Hort. Society</a> might be called upon to en<span class='line-break'></span>force the execution of the trusts under the tenth<span class='line-break'> </span>section, and if there should seem to be any doubt <span class='line-break'> </span>as to the construction of the language,  the actual in<span class='line-break'></span>terpretation formerly given by that <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'><!--Mass Hort-->Society</a> to its own <span class='line-break'> </span>charter, would if similar to the measure now pro- <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>posed, serve in some degree as an answer to any present <span class='line-break'> </span>objection from that quarter.  And even if no interpre<span class='line-break'></span>tation had been given by the <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'><!--Mass Hort-->Society</a> itself, or its offi<span class='line-break'></span>cers, to the Act of 1831, still the very language of <span class='line-break'> </span>that Act may serve to enlarge it or diminish the <span class='line-break'> </span>meaning of the present Company's charter.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Corporation derives <span class='line-break'> </span>no power to appropriate monies from the proceeds of <span class='line-break'> </span>sales of lots in the original cemetery to the purchase<span class='line-break'> </span>of statuary, from the ninth section.  Under that <span class='line-break'> </span>section, they may undoubtedly take statuary or <span class='line-break'> </span>money for the purchase of statuary, by bequest <span class='line-break'> </span>or donation and contract for its preservation in the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery.  But the words of the Act in that sec<span class='line-break'></span>tion are much larger than those in the tenth, <span class='line-break'> </span>and can only have a remote bearing upon the <span class='line-break'> </span>construction of the latter, as shewing what kind of<span class='line-break'> </span>"embellishments" the legislature considered appropriate <span class='line-break'> </span>to the Cemetery.</p>
<p>Coming then to the tenth section, we find that <span class='line-break'> </span>it provides that the portion of the proceeds of sales to be re<span class='line-break'></span>tained by the Proprietors of the Cemetery. "shall be forever de<span class='line-break'></span>"voted and applied to the presentation, improvement <s>and</s> em<span class='line-break'></span>"bellishment and enlargement of the said Cemetery and Garden<span class='line-break'> </span>" and the incidental expenses thereof <ins>and</ins> <ins>to no</ins> <ins>other </ins> <ins>purpose</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>"<ins>whatsoever</ins>".  These last words are strong words of re<span class='line-break'></span>straint upon the Corporation and should lead the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>to see that every appropriation made by them comes strict<span class='line-break'></span>ly under one or another of the heads thus mentioned.</p>

<p>And it is clear that the appropriation for the purchase of statu<span class='line-break'></span>arey can come fairly and fully under the one of these heads, <span class='line-break'> </span>only viz. that of the <ins>embellishment</ins> of the Cemetery.</p>
<p>We understand that it is not enough to <span class='line-break'> </span>bring an apropriation under this head, that it should <span class='line-break'> </span>be for the purpose of making the Cemetery a more attrac<span class='line-break'></span>tive resort; a collection of mere curiosities or relics of <span class='line-break'> </span>ancient times, however much they might "embellish" the <span class='line-break'> </span><del>Cemetery</del> place, in one sense, would not, in our judgment<span class='line-break'> </span>be such "embellishments" of the Cemetery as this section <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Act contemplates.  Neither would the establish<span class='line-break'></span>ment of an historical library, though that is in <span class='line-break'> </span>some sense the best monument to the worthy dead.<span class='line-break'> </span>Yet we suppose that, under the ninth section, you <span class='line-break'> </span>might properly allow the heir of any of our military <span class='line-break'> </span>heroes to hang the trophies of his father's victories above <span class='line-break'> </span>a mural tablet in the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a>, and the same might<span class='line-break'> </span>afterwards be given in trust to your care.  Other memo<span class='line-break'></span>rials of the worthy dead might thus gradually accumu<span class='line-break'></span>late under your care, and eventually the number of <span class='line-break'> </span>these relics of various kinds may make up such a collec<span class='line-break'></span>tion as you would not be authorized, in the first instance, <span class='line-break'> </span>to establish, as an independent thing, as an embellishment<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Cemetery.  An "embellishment" of the Cemetery in the <span class='line-break'> </span>10<sup>th</sup> section means, we think, an embellishment appropriate <span class='line-break'> </span>to and in harmony with the place.</p>
<p>These distinctions, though <span class='line-break'> </span>perhaps not at first obvious, are important.  Smaller ones <span class='line-break'> </span>have been made the foundation of decisions in many <span class='line-break'> </span>instances connected with the execution of trusts.

<p>Reasoning from the analogy of such decisions <span class='line-break'> </span>we might well say that it by no means follows <del>that</del><span class='line-break'> </span>as a matter of course, that because you have properly<span class='line-break'> </span>spent money for a <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a> in which Statues may be be<span class='line-break'></span>comingly placed, you may go on to <ins>provide</ins> Statues for <span class='line-break'> </span>the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a>.

<p>in that section.  On the contrary, the word "embellishment"<span class='line-break'> </span>is large enough to include statuary either in the open <span class='line-break'> </span>air or in the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a>.  In continuing the power of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Proprietors of the Cemetery,  we think that our Courts<span class='line-break'> </span>would not follow the strict interpretation which the <span class='line-break'> </span>English judges have given in the cases to which <span class='line-break'> </span>we have referred, but would meet the question in the <span class='line-break'> </span>same spirit which led them to declare in White<span class='line-break'> </span>v. Braintree   13 Metcalf's Reports. 513,   that the words<span class='line-break'> </span>"rights and privileges and immunities" as applied to parishes<span class='line-break'> </span>"and religious societies, are large enough and fitly<span class='line-break'> </span>"adapted to include a capacity to receive gifts and dona<span class='line-break'></span>"tions not only for the direct purposes for which they were <span class='line-break'> </span>"constituted, but for the purposes which, by usage and custom<span class='line-break'> </span>"and the general consent of enlightened persons, are re<span class='line-break'></span>"garded as analagous thereto."</p>
<p>The common definition of <u>embellishment</u> is <span class='line-break'> </span>"ornament" or "decoration".  But in Johnson's folio,<span class='line-break'> </span>he gives also "adventitous beauty" and "additional grace."<span class='line-break'> </span><u>Adscititious</u>, again he defined as meaning "that which <span class='line-break'> </span>"is taken in to complete something else, though originally <span class='line-break'> </span>"extrinsick."  Though a little pompous this definition <span class='line-break'> </span>seems to us remarkably exact, and to precisely describe <span class='line-break'> </span>the place which statuary will supply in the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel <span class='line-break'> </span>at Mount Auburn</a>.</p>
<p>Webster's definition is as satisfactory "any<span class='line-break'> </span>"thing that adds beauty or elegance; that which renders<span class='line-break'> </span>"anything pleasing to the eye, or agreeable to the taste,<span class='line-break'> </span>"in dress, furniture, manners or the fine arts".

<p>In noticing the change comtemplated by this report,<span class='line-break'> </span>I feel compelled to say that I do not understand the portion <span class='line-break'> </span>of it which states the object of the measure to be "the <u>pro-</u><span class='line-break'> </span><u>motion</u>  of <u>harmony</u> am<u>ong</u> <u>the agents of the Corporation</u>".<span class='line-break'> </span>So far as appears from the document, it will apparently <span class='line-break'> </span>affect the relations of no other persons than the new <span class='line-break'> </span>Assistant Superintendent and myself.

<p>given to the Trustees in September last, "<u>cooperated</u> <u>cor<span class='line-break'></span>dially</u>" with <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a> in every respect, and I have no <span class='line-break'> </span>complaint to make of any want of the same spirit on his <span class='line-break'> </span>part: were it otherwise, however, this measure would <span class='line-break'> </span>not be calculated to restore harmony, but rather the <span class='line-break'> </span>contrary.  The Trustees will pardon me, if I show this more <span class='line-break'> </span>particularly, not as a criticising of their action in reference <span class='line-break'> </span>to myself, but to suggest to them, the embarrassment of such <span class='line-break'> </span>relations, for the benefit of others who may succeed me. -</p>
<p>By the standing rules of the Cemetery, passed in 1841, it was <span class='line-break'> </span>made one of the duties of the Superintendent "to see <u>that</u> <u>all</u> <span class='line-break'> </span><u>persons in the employ of the Proprietors faithfully perform</u><span class='line-break'> </span><u>their duties</u>",  and he was also specially made responsible for <span class='line-break'> </span>various matters and things in connection with the labor <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; laborers.</p>
<p>By the report adopted in <date when='1855-03'>march 1855</date>, &amp; communicated <span class='line-break'> </span>to me in relation to the Office of an Assistant Superintendent,<span class='line-break'> </span>and defining his duties, it was stated as his duty <u>under</u><span class='line-break'> </span>the <u>Superintendent</u>, to have the immediate charge of the <span class='line-break'> </span>workmen, &amp; see that they perform the work assigned <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp;c. _ so much is harmonious: but it is obvious , that<span class='line-break'> </span>to hold one person responsible for the faithful perform<span class='line-break'></span>ance of work, while the sole power to engage &amp; discharge <span class='line-break'> </span>laborers is placed in the hands of his subordinate officer, <span class='line-break'> </span>would at once open the way for misunderstanding &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>differences.  This seems so clearly to me, to be the natural, <span class='line-break'> </span>if not the necessary result, that I cannot but apprehend<span class='line-break'> </span>that the Trustees feel that some want of "harmony"<span class='line-break'> </span>exists elsewhere than between me and my Assistant, and <span class='line-break'> </span>if this be so, it may serve to explain some other</p>

<p>things in the report in question, which are not clear <span class='line-break'> </span>to me at present. -</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the Trustees meant to put the<span class='line-break'> </span>two offices on an equal footing, and to revoke the rule <span class='line-break'> </span>laid down in March last, in their general plan de<span class='line-break'></span>fining the duties of present &amp; future officers "by which <span class='line-break'> </span>it was made the duty of the Assistant to act under<span class='line-break'> </span>the <u>Superintendent"</u>, it would  be a measure which would <span class='line-break'> </span>not change my view of my present duty.</p>
<p>Two independent executive officers at the Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>without one directing mind above them, would not <span class='line-break'> </span>only not "<u>promote harmony</u>" , but would seriously interfere<span class='line-break'> </span>with the interest of the Proprietors.</p>
<p>The Trustees all know that I have, for several<span class='line-break'> </span>years, been desirous to withdraw from the Office of Sup<span class='line-break'></span>erintendent, &amp; that I have tendered my resignation to <span class='line-break'> </span>them.  Most of the Trustees know that the only reason <span class='line-break'> </span>why I did not peremptorily withdraw at once after the last <span class='line-break'> </span>Annual meeting, was in order that some person might <span class='line-break'> </span>be so far initiated into the duties of the office before I <span class='line-break'> </span>left, that individual proprietors might not be inconve<span class='line-break'></span>nienced, &amp; that the interests of the Corporation might not <span class='line-break'> </span>suffer by my action.</p>
<p>The reason no longer exists.  <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a> has become <span class='line-break'> </span>somewhat acquainted in the Cemetery, &amp; has, no doubt, <span class='line-break'> </span>the confidence of the Trustees.

<p>The undersigned is aware that a diversity of <span class='line-break'> </span>opinion has existed upon the expediency, as well as the <span class='line-break'> </span>right of the Trustees to expend the money of the Corpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion for purposes extraneous to, if not directly adverse<span class='line-break'> </span>to the privileges conferred upon it by the Charter.</p>
<p>By the Act of incorporation, the Trustees were<span class='line-break'> </span>allowed to expend the money received from the sale <span class='line-break'> </span>of lots 'for the preservation, improvement, embellishment<span class='line-break'> </span>and enlargement of the Cemetery and Garden, and the <span class='line-break'> </span>incidental expenses thereof, &amp; for no other purpose what<span class='line-break'></span>soever."</p>
<p>The question then naturally arises what is the <span class='line-break'> </span>obvious &amp; real meaning of these terms, and what construc<span class='line-break'></span>tion was designed to be placed upon them?</p>
<p>In order that a correct conclusion may be arrived at, <span class='line-break'> </span>it is necessary to revert for a moment, to the circumstances <span class='line-break'> </span>under which the act of incorporation was obtained, and <span class='line-break'> </span>what was designed by those who originated the project.<span class='line-break'> </span>It appears to the undersigned, that the design was this <span class='line-break'></span>the subject of interments within the limits of the City having <span class='line-break'> </span>become one of great importance in our community, and <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>an evil which would be likely to increase as the <span class='line-break'> </span>population became more dense, it was very desirable <span class='line-break'> </span>that the system should be changed, so far as it was practicable<span class='line-break'> </span>to do so, &amp; some place of interment be secured in the vicinity <span class='line-break'> </span>of the <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>City<!--of Boston--></a> which should obviate the evil complained of. _</p>
<p>For these purposes the grounds now known as <span class='line-break'> </span>"Mount Auburn" were obtained &amp; consecrated.</p>
<p>An act of incorporation was granted by the Legis<span class='line-break'></span>lature, giving certain privilesges to, &amp; placing certain <span class='line-break'> </span>restrictions upon the Corporation, one of which was that <span class='line-break'> </span>the moneys received from the sales of lots should be ex<span class='line-break'></span>pended for no other purpose than those stated in this <span class='line-break'> </span>report.</p>
<p>It is obvious from the terms of the Charter that the <span class='line-break'> </span>right to erect an expensive <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->chapel</a>, and furnish it with <span class='line-break'> </span>splendid statuary, or other works of art, if it exists at <span class='line-break'> </span>all, must be derived fro the authority to embellish the <span class='line-break'> </span>grounds. _</p>
<p>An opinion has been given by one of the present <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee, (<a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>Mr Curtis</a>) that the Trustees do possess the legal <span class='line-break'> </span>right, at least so far as to expend fifteen thousand dol<span class='line-break'></span>ars for Statuary: which opinion is on the records of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation; and, as it has been accepted &amp; acted upon <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Trustees, it is not necessary here to discuss the <span class='line-break'> </span>question, nor to say how large a field the word "embellishment"<span class='line-break'> </span>appears to the undersigned to cover. _</p>
<p>If then it be assumed for the purposes of this discus<span class='line-break'></span>sion, that the Trustees have the legal right, the next <span class='line-break'> </span>question is as to the expediency of spending money for such <span class='line-break'> </span>embellishments. _<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>not have been the case. _ But if it were so, the under<span class='line-break'></span>signed can see in that fact no good reason why the <span class='line-break'> </span>design should be carried out, if it be inexpedient to<span class='line-break'> </span>do so. _ That such however was the original design,<span class='line-break'> </span>would hardly be gathered from the language of <a href='/pages/subjects/53237' title='Story, Joseph'>Judge <span class='line-break'> </span>Story</a>, as quoted in the legal opinion before referred to,<span class='line-break'> </span>or if it were the design that it was known to him. _</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>Mr. Curtis</a> says in that opinion "It is worth ^<sup>noting</sup> nothing <span class='line-break'> </span>here, that <a href='/pages/subjects/53237' title='Story, Joseph'>Judge Story</a> in 1843, in a written report <span class='line-break'> </span>upon the subject of contemplated improvements at the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery, alludes particularly to the use of the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->proposed chapel</a> <span class='line-break'> </span>for the purpose of a shelter for busts &amp; statues, but is guarded <span class='line-break'> </span>in his language, &amp; refers only to such "marble busts and <span class='line-break'> </span>statues &amp; other sepulchral monuments which may from <span class='line-break'> </span>time to time be placed there by liberal benefactors &amp; friends<span class='line-break'> </span>in memory of the dead' _ and <a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>Mr Curtis</a> adds _<span class='line-break'> </span>'<u>It is probable</u> <u>that it had not then occurred to his</u> <span class='line-break'> </span><u>mind that</u> <u>the Trustees would</u> <u>ever take this thing upon</u> <span class='line-break'> </span><u> themselves.</u>.  It is therefore very plain, that <a href='/pages/subjects/53237' title='Story, Joseph'>Judge Story</a>, <span class='line-break'> </span>the first President of the Corporation, was ignorant of the <span class='line-break'> </span>fact that these statues formed a part of the original <span class='line-break'> </span>design.</p>
<p>The undersigned is of opinion, that if the amount <span class='line-break'> </span>to be paid for these statues should be placed at interest <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; the income derived from it be spent upon the grounds, _<span class='line-break'> </span>in keeping them in more perfect order than has hitherto<span class='line-break'> </span>been the case, that it would be far more for the repu<span class='line-break'></span>tation of the place, and the pleasure &amp; comfort of the visitors<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; proprietors, than would be the exhibition of the statuary <span class='line-break'> </span>however beautiful. _</p>

<p>87</p>
<p>One among the many reasons why this statuary should <span class='line-break'> </span>not be procured, is the state of the finances of the Corporation. _<span class='line-break'> </span>By the last annual report fo the Treasurer, it appears <span class='line-break'> </span>that the property belonging to the Corporation amounted to <span class='line-break'> </span>the sum of $29,900. Estimating the stocks in which it <span class='line-break'> </span>was invested at par _ while nearly all of them are greatly <span class='line-break'> </span>depreciated. _ It also appears by the Treasurer's report,<span class='line-break'> </span>that the expenditures exceeded the income, (which included<span class='line-break'> </span>the sales of lots during the year) $252.51. We shall<span class='line-break'> </span>therefore find, when all the lots are sold, if we proceed<span class='line-break'> </span>in this manner, that we have the embellishments on hand,<span class='line-break'> </span>but no fund &amp; no means to meet the current expenses <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Corporation. _</p>
<p>Another reason why the statuary should not be placed <span class='line-break'> </span>in the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a> is, that in the opinion of many persons<span class='line-break'> </span>who profess, or are supposed to be judges in such matters, the <span class='line-break'> </span>light will not be good, and the beauties of the statues will not<span class='line-break'> </span>be seen to advantage, nor justice be done to the artists who <span class='line-break'> </span>shall construct them. _</p>
<p>But it is not necessary here to detail all the objections <span class='line-break'> </span>to the plan. _</p>
<p>The undersigned believes that an arrangement can be <span class='line-break'> </span>entered into with the artists who have been engaged to make<span class='line-break'> </span>the statues, to relinquish the contracts by making them a liberal<span class='line-break'> </span>compensation for the work already done: but if that cannot <span class='line-break'> </span>be accomplished, that some disposition can be made of the <span class='line-break'> </span>statues when completed, by which a large part of the expen<span class='line-break'></span>diture may be returned to the Corporation; and if only<span class='line-break'> </span>one half of the amount should be saved, that sum at <span class='line-break'> </span>compound interest, in twelve years would give the original</p>
