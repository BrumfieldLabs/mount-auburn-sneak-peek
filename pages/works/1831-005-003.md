<p>"On the <date when='1853-07-05'>5<sup>th</sup> of July, 1853</date>, a vote was <span class='line-break'> </span>passed 'that the Gate-Keeper be permitted to <span class='line-break'> </span>admit persons of respectable appearance and <span class='line-break'> </span>demeanor to ride into the Cemetery without tickets<span class='line-break'> </span>or permits until further orders'.</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> article of the By- Laws provides that <span class='line-break'> </span>'strangers from a distance, also persons having <span class='line-break'> </span>business in the Cemetery, may be admitted with <span class='line-break'> </span>carriages on presenting a note or ticket of admis<span class='line-break'></span>sion signed by a Trustee or by the Secretary <span class='line-break'> </span>or Treasurer,'</p>

<p>From the preceding citations it appears clearly <span class='line-break'> </span>to the Committee, <u>first</u>, that the By-Laws con<span class='line-break'></span>tain regulations and restrictions in regard to <span class='line-break'> </span>admission to the grounds.  <u>Second</u>, That <span class='line-break'> </span>notwithstanding these general limitations, the whole<span class='line-break'> </span>power of regulating the admission of non-pro<span class='line-break'></span>prietors is vested in the Trustees without reference<span class='line-break'> </span>to the By-Laws.  <u>Third</u>, That any vote not <span class='line-break'> </span>incompatible with the By-Laws, which had <span class='line-break'> </span>been passed prior to their adoption, and which <span class='line-break'> </span>has not been repealed, is now extant, and</p>

<p>The question of admission to the Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>is a delicate one.  Mount Auburn, although <span class='line-break'> </span>strictly a private institution, may in some senses, <span class='line-break'> </span>be considered a public one.  It is the pioneer<span class='line-break'> </span>of ornamental cemeteries _ the delight and pride<span class='line-break'> </span>of our own citizens, and the admiration of <span class='line-break'> </span>strangers.  It has caused many other institutions <span class='line-break'> </span>of like character to spring up all over the country,<span class='line-break'> </span>and its fame extends wherever <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>Boston</a> is known.<span class='line-break'> </span>It is natural therefore, that all strangers visiting <span class='line-break'> </span>this part of the country, should be desirous of seeing <span class='line-break'> </span>it, and it is the wish of the Trustes to grant every <span class='line-break'> </span>facility for the gratification of this desire, and also <span class='line-break'> </span>for the accommodation of resident non-proprietors,<span class='line-break'> </span>so far as they can do in justice to the <span class='line-break'> </span>interests committed to them</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that the num<span class='line-break'></span>ber of proprietors now approaches three thousand,<span class='line-break'> </span>all of whom have the right of admission in <span class='line-break'> </span>carriages; add to this the surreptitious use <span class='line-break'> </span>of the tickets of proprietors, which cannot be <span class='line-break'> </span>prevented, and the tickets issued for single <span class='line-break'> </span>admissions, and an aggregate will be shown <span class='line-break'> </span>quite sufficient to make the grounds as public<span class='line-break'> </span>as can reasonably be required.</p>
<p>The facility of obtaining tickets appears to the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee quite sufficient for strangers and others <span class='line-break'> </span>who may wish to visit the grounds for proper objects, <span class='line-break'> </span>and if each one be obliged to deliver his ticket <span class='line-break'> </span>at the gate, it will render it much easier to <span class='line-break'> </span>detect those who abuse their privileges.</p>

<p>Looking at the subject in all its aspects, the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee are of opinion, that although the pro<span class='line-break'></span>hibition of some of the privileges which the public <span class='line-break'> </span>have enjoyed may cause some inconvenience<span class='line-break'> </span>and dissatisfaction, yet that a much greater <span class='line-break'> </span>evil would arise if the Cemetery were injured,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the proprietors annoyed by persons merely <span class='line-break'> </span>seeking amusement regardless of injury to others;<span class='line-break'> </span>and, as all have the  privilege of walking in <span class='line-break'> </span>the grounds, they think, of two evils it is better <span class='line-break'> </span>to choose the less: they therefore recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>the repeal of the vote of the <date when='1853-07-05'>5<sup>th</sup> of July 1853</date>,<span class='line-break'> </span>granting permission to enter without a ticket.<span class='line-break'> </span>They would also recommend that the Secretary <span class='line-break'> </span>be directed to furnish tickets to the Proprietors <span class='line-break'> </span>of the prinipal hotels, for the use of strangers, <span class='line-break'> </span>in which the name of the visitor shall be inserted<span class='line-break'> </span>with the admonition that any abuse of this priv<span class='line-break'></span>ilege on the part of the drivers, will cause such <span class='line-break'> </span>driver to be afterwards excluded, and, if after<span class='line-break'> </span>proper representation to the proprietor of the hotel,<span class='line-break'> </span>the same driver shall be furnished with <span class='line-break'> </span>tickets - then that the privileges be withdrawn <span class='line-break'> </span>from the Hotel.</p>
<p>They would also recommend that the <span class='line-break'> </span>Gate Keeper be instructed to require the delivery <span class='line-break'> </span>of all tickets except those of proprietors, at <span class='line-break'> </span>the Gate, and that the same be returned to the Secretary.</p>

<p>_________________ <b>Report:</b> ________________</p>
<p>Many years ago, the rule was established <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Board of  Trustees, that no person <span class='line-break'> </span>should be admitted on horseback, in <span class='line-break'> </span>consequence of abuses to which that prac<span class='line-break'></span>tice was liable.

<p>While therefore it is necessary to have <span class='line-break'> </span>some general law prohibiting the admis<span class='line-break'></span>sion of persons on horseback, the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee are of opinion that there <span class='line-break'> </span>may be a modification of it without <span class='line-break'> </span>injury to the grounds on the one hand,<span class='line-break'> </span>or injustice to any of the proprietors on <span class='line-break'> </span>the other.  It would of course be improper<span class='line-break'> </span>for the Trustees to grant a privilege to <span class='line-break'> </span>one proprietor, which they denied to anoth<span class='line-break'></span>er, _ therefore they cannot give the priv<span class='line-break'></span>ilege to one, without granting it to all. _<span class='line-break'> </span>In making their general rules however, <span class='line-break'> </span>it is perfectly competent for them to grant <span class='line-break'> </span>privileges under certain conditions, and any <span class='line-break'> </span>one of the proprietors who chooses can avail <span class='line-break'> </span>of that privilege, and if there be no distinction, <span class='line-break'> </span>no reasonable ground of complaint can exist.</p>
<p>In this way we prohibit the indiscriminate <span class='line-break'> </span>right of building tombs _ but grant that right <span class='line-break'> </span>to any and all proprietors who will comply <span class='line-break'> </span>with certain rules, and pay a reasonable <span class='line-break'> </span>bonus for the privilege. _</p>
<p>The Committee think that in such <span class='line-break'> </span>cases as <a href='/pages/subjects/59933' title='Brewer, Gardner'>Mr Brewer</a>'s and many others, it <span class='line-break'> </span>may not only be for the personal comfort<span class='line-break'> </span>and convenience of the proprietors, but for <span class='line-break'> </span>the interest of Mount Auburn that permission</p>

<p>"The Committee on Investigation &amp;c having made<span class='line-break'> </span>reports to the Board from time to time of their <span class='line-break'> </span>progress, it only remains for them now to state <span class='line-break'> </span>the final result of their examination, so far as <span class='line-break'> </span>they have been able to arrive at it, although a few <span class='line-break'> </span>days more may be required to complete the work <span class='line-break'> </span>assigned to them, should the Board deem it ad<span class='line-break'></span>visable to finish it.  The result however will<span class='line-break'> </span>not probably be affected to any considerable extent<span class='line-break'> </span>and although some further trifling discrepancies<span class='line-break'> </span>may be discovered, the present statement shows<span class='line-break'> </span>substantially the deficit in the accounts of the Sup<span class='line-break'></span>erintendent so far as the partial returns from <span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors and the confused state of the books <span class='line-break'> </span>allow of any examination. _</p>
<p>The Committee have received bills from about <span class='line-break'> </span>800 proprietors.  How many others have paid <span class='line-break'> </span>bills, it is impossible to tell.</p>
<p>These bills as stated in a former report are <span class='line-break'> </span>of two classes - one for work actually done <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Corporation for proprietors, the amount of <span class='line-break'> </span>which belongs exclusively to the Corporation, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the other in whole or in part for granite work,<span class='line-break'> </span>a part of which may have been collected <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Superintendent, for account of the Stone-cutters,<span class='line-break'> </span>and what proportion of which belongs to the Cor<span class='line-break'></span>poration, it is impracticable for the Committee</p>

<p>In the first class _ to wit, bills exclusively <span class='line-break'> </span>for account of the Corporation, the Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>find that in 131 cases the bills receipted are <span class='line-break'> </span>for a larger sum than the amount credited<span class='line-break'> </span>by the Superintendent, the aggregate of which<span class='line-break'> </span><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>discrepancies is</th> <th>$4,152.14<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>In seven cases, an excess was credited of</td> <td><u>54.50</u></td> </tr> <tr><td>which leaves a balance of</td> <td>$4,097.64</td> </tr> <tr><td>The difference in the bills</td> <td>___</td> </tr> <tr><td>in whole or in part for granite is</td> <td>$4,377.74</td> </tr> <tr><td>To which we add the bills</td> <td>___</td> </tr> <tr><td>of <a href='/pages/subjects/60951' title='O&apos;Donnell'>O'Donnell</a> and <a href='/pages/subjects/57835' title='Black, James'>Black</a> referred</td> <td>___</td> </tr> <tr><td>to in the last report</td> <td><u>463.25</u></td> </tr> <tr><td>___</td> <td>___</td> </tr> <tr><td>which makes a total of</td> <td>$8,938.63</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span class='line-break'> </span>Thus much is derived from a comparison <span class='line-break'> </span>of bills with the accounts of the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The Committee on Investigation, &amp;c. having com<span class='line-break'></span>pleted their labors, so far as it is practicable to do so, now<span class='line-break'> </span>make their final report.</p>
<p>As it has been stated in our previous commun<span class='line-break'></span>cations, it must be obvious to all, that this exami<span class='line-break'></span>nation must in the nature of the case, be only <span class='line-break'> </span>a partial one, and that there may be a further <span class='line-break'> </span>deficit of thousands of dollars entirely unknown <span class='line-break'> </span>to the Committee.  As an instance of this, we will <span class='line-break'> </span>state the case of <a href='/pages/subjects/57848' title='Merriam, Charles'>Mr Charles Merriam</a>.  Within a <span class='line-break'> </span>few days he has sent in two bills _ one of over a <span class='line-break'> </span>thousand dollars to the <a href='/pages/subjects/66004' title='Granite Railway Company'>Granite Railway Co.</a> which <span class='line-break'> </span>was paid to <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a>, and which we have ascer<span class='line-break'></span>tained was paid by him to <a href='/pages/subjects/66004' title='Granite Railway Company'>the Railway Co</a>: the other <span class='line-break'> </span>was for work done by the Cemetery amounting to $328, <span class='line-break'> </span>and the amount of which should have been cred<span class='line-break'></span>ited by <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a>.  Of this money, however, paid <span class='line-break'> </span>by <a href='/pages/subjects/57848' title='Merriam, Charles'>Mr Merriam</a> to <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a>, no trace can be <span class='line-break'> </span>found either in the cash book, leger or journals:<span class='line-break'> </span>the only place where <a href='/pages/subjects/57848' title='Merriam, Charles'>Mr Merriam's</a> name appears <span class='line-break'> </span>upon the books being for a small charge of $8 the <span class='line-break'> </span>following year.  How many other cases of like na<span class='line-break'></span>ture may have occurred we have not the means <span class='line-break'> </span>of knowing, and we did not discover this until <span class='line-break'> </span>some three or four months after the proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>had been requested to send in their bills.</p>

This land is composed chiefly of a wet<span class='line-break'> </span>bog, and a very steep bank, neither of them convertible <span class='line-break'> </span>to Cemetery purposes without a large outlay for filling <span class='line-break'> </span>up and altering their grade.

Supposing them to be <span class='line-break'> </span>all sold in twenty or twenty five years, at present <span class='line-break'> </span>full prices, they would not bring the accumulated <span class='line-break'> </span>value of three thousand dollars paid at the present <span class='line-break'> </span>time.</p>
<p>As to the cost of  constructing <a href='/pages/subjects/58208' title='Alice Fountain'><!--Alice-->the fountain</a>, if it <span class='line-break'> </span>is found on experiment that we can afford to waste <span class='line-break'> </span>the water after it is used, the fountain can be made<span class='line-break'> </span>for fifteen hundred dollars. _ But if the water is saved <span class='line-break'> </span>and returned to the well, the whole cost, including laid <span class='line-break'> </span>pipes and a water tight basin would not exceed three</p>
