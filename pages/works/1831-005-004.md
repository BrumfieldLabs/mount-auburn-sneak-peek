<p>Among the occurrences worthy of note in the last years' history<span class='line-break'> </span>of Mount Auburn, is the purchase of two lots or pieces of land<span class='line-break'> </span>situated on the oustide of the Cemetery, and separated from <span class='line-break'> </span>it by an intervening road. One of these, sometimes called<span class='line-break'> </span>the "Stone Meadow" is situated on the easterly side of<span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge Avenue, and has been brought of the heirs of Cornelius<span class='line-break'> </span>Stone, at the price of $1000 ~ per acre, the lot containing<span class='line-break'> </span>over five and a half acres, and costing the Corporation $5,543.75.<span class='line-break'> </span>This lot, consisting in part of low or wet land, is to be used<span class='line-break'> </span>as a place of temporary deposit for stone, rubbish and building<span class='line-break'> </span>materials, thereby releasing a more valuable portion of land<span class='line-break'> </span>now used for the same purposes within the Cemetery. It is <span class='line-break'> </span>possible that, at some future time, the engine house with its<span class='line-break'> </span>appurtenances may be removed in the same direction, with<span class='line-break'> </span>the same economical purpose. The other purchase is that of a<span class='line-break'> </span>part of an acre of land, with a dwelling house thereon, situated<span class='line-break'> </span>nearly opposite the front gate of the Cemetery, and bought<span class='line-break'> </span>of A. M<sup>c</sup>Donald, for $4,000 ~. For various reasons, it was<span class='line-break'> </span>thought desirable that the Corporation should control this<span class='line-break'> </span>estate.</p>
<p>The work of reclaiming low lands in eligible situations has<span class='line-break'> </span>gone steadily forward. The entire hill on which the<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent's house stood, thirteen years ago, has been<span class='line-break'> </span>levelled, and the earth used to fill up the meadow about<span class='line-break'> </span>Halcyon Lake, and also to restore the necessary grade<span class='line-break'> </span>where made lands have settled, as in some parts of the Lawn,<span class='line-break'> </span>and of the meadow adjoining Thistle Path.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>Considerable sums have been expended in completing the _<span class='line-break'> </span>improvements in S<sup>t</sup> Paul's lot, Central Avenue, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>bank north of the Chapel. As the expense of these necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>improvements within the Cemetery has been shared by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Horticultural Society, an exact account of the sums expended<span class='line-break'> </span>for such purposes, has been rendered to them, and, with a<span class='line-break'> </span>view to prevent any future misapprehension, a new indenture<span class='line-break'> </span>of two parts has been sigend and executed by the authorized<span class='line-break'> </span>agents of the two parties.</p>
<p>A decided progress has been made this winter in removing<span class='line-break'> </span>the superfluous trees and branches from the Cemetery. About<span class='line-break'> </span>one hundred and seventy five cords of wood have already<span class='line-break'> </span>been piled for sale, and much more will be removed during the<span class='line-break'> </span>winter. A marked improvement is already obvious in the<span class='line-break'> </span>variety of the landscape, the extent of the prospect, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>admission of sunlight to the ground. The work of this removal<span class='line-break'> </span>is slow and laborious, owing to the necessity of taking down<span class='line-break'> </span>the trees piecemeal, to avoid danger to neighboring monuments<span class='line-break'> </span>and works of art.</p>
<p>A new border of increased size has been procured for the<span class='line-break'> </span>steam engine, and, for its accommodation, an addition has<span class='line-break'> </span>been made to the engine house, the whole at a cost of about<span class='line-break'> </span>eleven hundred dollars.</p>
<p>A lease having been taken by the Corporation, of rooms at N<sup>o</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>16 Pemberton Square, in Boston, for ten years, it was<span class='line-break'> </span>decided by the Trustees to place the offices of the Secretary<span class='line-break'> </span>and Treasurer in the same building. At this time George<span class='line-break'> </span>W. Bond Esq who has acceptably filled the office of Treasurer<span class='line-break'> </span>for twenty six years, resigned that office, and the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>During a period of nearly forty years, the institution and<span class='line-break'> </span>its property have thus been managed successfully and safely.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Cemetery and its funds have been protected, and have yearly<span class='line-break'> </span>increased, and no imputation of neglect or dishonor has fallen<span class='line-break'> </span>upon any Trustee.

<p>The whole subject of Salaries having been referred<span class='line-break'> </span>to the same Committee _ They beg leave to Report. _</p>
<p>When the office of Treasurer was transferred to<span class='line-break'> </span>the present incumbent, it was supposed that with temporary<span class='line-break'> </span>assistance he could perform the duties of Secretary and<span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer.

To enable him<span class='line-break'> </span>to make this arrangement, the committee unanimously<span class='line-break'> </span>recommend the addition of Five hundred dollars to his<span class='line-break'> </span>salary as Treasurer, making the total amount of his<span class='line-break'> </span>salary as Treasurer for 1869 Fifteen hundred dollars,<span class='line-break'> </span>instead of One thousand dollars as originally fixed for<span class='line-break'> </span>1868:</p>
<p>The Committee have also considered the application<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Gate-Keeper for additional compensation. They have<span class='line-break'> </span>ascertained that the has performed his duties acceptably,<span class='line-break'> </span>and is a useful man in that position, and recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>an addition to his salary for 1869 of Fifty dollars, making<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
