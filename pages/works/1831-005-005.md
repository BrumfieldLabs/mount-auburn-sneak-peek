<p>The Special Committee to whom were referred the <span class='line-break'> </span>applications of H. W. Mussey and J. G. Coolidge for payment of <span class='line-break'> </span>damages caused to their estates by grading Coolidge Avenue by the <span class='line-break'> </span>City of Cambidge in 1869 submit the following</p>
<p>Report.</p>
<p>In the year 1862 a claim made that this Corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>was bound to grade and repair the Avenue was referred to <span class='line-break'> </span>Messrs C. P. Curtis and E. S. Rand, and from their full ex=<span class='line-break'> </span>=amination and report we find that the fee of the Avenue is <span class='line-break'> </span>in this Corporation, that it was laid out as a private way <span class='line-break'> </span>in 1830, and has since been open to public travel.  It is not <span class='line-break'> </span>a public way except by dedication.  Since 1846 no way can <span class='line-break'> </span>be made public unless laid out by the public authorities.  As <span class='line-break'> </span>the corporation as lately as 1848 exercised its power of granting <span class='line-break'> </span>rights in the way it seems clear it has never become a public<span class='line-break'> </span>way by dedication.</p>
<p>The original agreement between Brimmer and Josiah <span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge provided that this way should be kept open and un=<span class='line-break'> </span>obstructed, and that said Coolidge, his heirs and assigns, should<span class='line-break'> </span>at all times have free ingress and regress to and from his ad=<span class='line-break'> </span>=joining land into said way.

<p>the petitioners, and the City of Cambridge all claim rights in <span class='line-break'> </span>the way as assigns of J. Coolidge.</p>
<p>In 1868, the way being out of repair, the question of <span class='line-break'> </span>its improvement was brought before the Board as follows: -</p>
<p>"M^r Cheever having made a statement that the City of <span class='line-break'> </span>"Cambridge contemplated the improvement of the grade of <span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge Avenue, it was</p>
<p>"Voted[underlined] - that Messrs. Cheever and Norcross be a Com=<span class='line-break'> </span>"=mittee to arrange with the City of Cambridge for the payment <span class='line-break'> </span>" of $250. - by this Corporation when said grading shall have <span class='line-break'> </span>"been completed to the satisfaction of the Committee. "</p>
<p>In 1869 the grading was completed which has caused <span class='line-break'> </span>the injuries complained [of] [sq. bracket original]</p>
<p>The grade of the sidewalk at the entrance to M^r<span class='line-break'> </span>Muzzey's estate, (then owned by M^r Lawrence,) was reduced <span class='line-break'> </span>about three feet, and no support being provided for the wall<span class='line-break'> </span>on the line of the estate it has since fallen, and besides <span class='line-break'> </span>rebuilding the wall a considerable expense has been incurred<span class='line-break'> </span>in reducing the grade of his roadway to the new grade of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Avenue.  A similar but less reduction in grade was <span class='line-break'> </span>made in front of M^r Coolidge's estate.  He claims that <span class='line-break'> </span>a bank wall is necessary in front of his land, and that <span class='line-break'> </span>access to his premises has been rendered more difficult.</p>
<p>Both parties base their claim against this Corpora=<span class='line-break'> </span>=tion, upon the allegation that the City of Cambridge, in <span class='line-break'> </span>making the changes of grade acted as the licensee or agent <span class='line-break'> </span>of the orporation as owner of the fee.</p>
<p>If this were the fact the Committee are not prepared</p>

The vote was simply an agreement to contribute<span class='line-break'> </span>to the expense, in case the work was done satisfactorily to <span class='line-break'> </span>its Committee.</p>
<p>Before the work was completed complaints were made <span class='line-break'> </span>by M^r Coolidge, and it appears from the correspondence on file <span class='line-break'> </span>that the Mayor of Cambridge was distinctly informed by M^r<span class='line-break'> </span>Norcross that this Corporation would not undertake to arrange <span class='line-break'> </span>with M^r Coolidge, would do nothing about the proposed changes, <span class='line-break'> </span>but that the city must take the whole responsibility.</p>
<p>On November 7^th, 1869, after M^r Coolidge's claim had <span class='line-break'> </span>been presented to the Board, it was</p>
<p>"Voted, [underlined] - that the Treasurer be authorized to pay $250. <span class='line-break'></span>"to the City of Cambridge for the improvement made upon Coolidge <span class='line-break'> </span>"Avenue, upon receiving from said City a sufficient bond of in=<span class='line-break'> </span>=demnity against any claim for damages by the abuttors, or a <span class='line-break'> </span>"satisfactory release from said abuttors."</p>
<p>Several demands have since been made for the payment <span class='line-break'> </span>of this money, but the terms of the vote not having been com=<span class='line-break'> </span>=plied with, nothing has been paid.

<p>TRUSTEES' REPORT.</p>
<p>DURING the past year considerable advance has been made<span class='line-break'> </span>in the excavation and improvement of Halcyon Lake, the<span class='line-break'> </span>dryness of the season permitting the work commenced in the <span class='line-break'> </span>autumn of 1871 to be continued during the winter months.</p>
<p>Improvements have also been made in Hazel Dell, Palm,<span class='line-break'> </span>Maple, Sycamore and Yew Avenues, the Watriss Lot, vicinity<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Engine-house and other localities, and a house has been<span class='line-break'> </span>erected for the accommodation of the swans and other<span class='line-break'> </span>water fowl.</p>
<p>The Watriss Lot has been connected with the Cemetery by<span class='line-break'> </span>the removal of the stockade which formed the division line,<span class='line-break'> </span>and a substantial wooden fence has been erected on the new<span class='line-break'> </span>boundary.</p>
<p>The drainage of Spruce Avenue and the surrounding<span class='line-break'> </span>territory has long been the subject of careful consideration,<span class='line-break'> </span>and conferences have been held with proprietors whose lots<span class='line-break'> </span>are affected, but all plans heretofore suggested, if feasible at<span class='line-break'> </span>all, would have involved large expenditures.</p>
<p>Recently negotiations have been concluded for the purchase<span class='line-break'> </span>of the "Chant Lot," containing about tow and one-half acres<span class='line-break'> </span>of land, the possession of which it is believed will enable a<span class='line-break'> </span>plan to be matured for the drainage of the low section at a <span class='line-break'> </span>reasonable cost; securing also a desirable addition to the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery.</p>
<p>In August last a monumental statue, imitated from the<span class='line-break'> </span>Sphinx of antiquity, and designed to commemorate the great<span class='line-break'> </span>war of American conservation, was placed on its pedestal in<span class='line-break'> </span>front of the Chapel at Mount Auburn. It is cut from a single<span class='line-break'> </span>block of Hallowell Granite, fifteen feet long, by about eight<span class='line-break'> </span>feet in height, the face along measuring three feet in length.<span class='line-break'> </span>It is a gift to the Proprietors of the Cemetery from the late<span class='line-break'> </span>President, Dr. Jacob Bigelow, and was executed under his<span class='line-break'> </span>direction by Martin Milmore, the distinguished sculptor.</p>
<p>The pedestal is of a plain oblong form, with emblems and<span class='line-break'> </span>inscriptions. Its emblems are simple, being on the southern<span class='line-break'> </span>end a figure of the Egyptian Lotus, and on the northern the<span class='line-break'> </span>American Water Lily. On the two remaining sides are<span class='line-break'> </span>inscriptions, on in Latin, the other in English, as follows: <span class='line-break'></span></p>

<p>TRUSTEE'S REPORT.</p>
<p>THE outlay of previous years having placed the grounds<span class='line-break'> </span>in an acceptable and attractive condition, the past year has<span class='line-break'> </span>not been marked by any extensive new operations. The<span class='line-break'> </span>funds and assets of the Corporation are in a satisfactory state,<span class='line-break'> </span>while the receipts from sales of lots have fully realized the<span class='line-break'> </span>anticipations of the Trustees and demonstrated the wisdom <span class='line-break'> </span>of the liberal expenditures that have been made for the<span class='line-break'> </span>preservation and embellishment of the Cemetery. The<span class='line-break'> </span>following is a summary of the most important acts of the year.</p>
<p>A vacancy having occurred in the office of Superintendent,<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr. James W. Lovering was unanimously elected, and since<span class='line-break'> </span>entering upon the duties of the position, in April, has given<span class='line-break'> </span>entire satisfaction to the Board, and they believe to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietors generally.</p>
<p>The Chant Lot, so called, the purchase of which was<span class='line-break'> </span>mentioned in the last annual report, has been properly fenced<span class='line-break'> </span>and formally annexed to the Cemetery; plans for laying out<span class='line-break'> </span>the territory are being prepared and will soon be submitted<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Trustees for their action.</p>
<p>A plan for laying out the Stone Farm has been adopted,<span class='line-break'> </span>and at a recent meeting of the Trustees, it was voted, that<span class='line-break'> </span>a portion of said land, say six acres, be reserved for sale,<span class='line-break'> </span>under such restrictions as will carry out the Landscape Lawn<span class='line-break'> </span>system, and that the balance of the lot be withheld from<span class='line-break'> </span>sale until further action by the Board, it being their intention<span class='line-break'> </span>to hereacter offer the same under similar restrictions if the<span class='line-break'> </span>new system proves in accordance with the demands of the<span class='line-break'> </span>public taste. In consequence of the addition of territory</p>

<p>TRUSTEES' REPORT</p>
<p>The general depression of business which has prevailed during the past season, has not been without its effect upon the affairs of this Corporation. The receipts from sales of lots have, in consequence, fallen off considerably. Still, the usual expenses, and the yearly payment to the reserved fund have all been met from the year's receipts, and only for special expenditures for improvements has any drain been made upon the surplus assets of the last year. The affairs of the Corporation therefore remain in a satisfactory condition, though it would have been gratifying to have had a larger amount for expenditure upon the uncompleted improvements, and for the adornment of the Cemetery grounds.</p>
<p>During the past season work has been commenced on the bank of Indian Ridge on Fountain Avenue. About two hundred and eighty feet have been re-graded and sodded, and the improved appearance of the bank warrants the expenditure already made.</p>
<p>The greenhouse, commence late last year, has been finished, and rendered important aid during the past summer in supplying the constantly increasing demand for plants.</p>
<p>The fence on the line of the Roman Catholic Cemetery and Chant Lot, being beyond repair, has been replaced by a higher and more substantial wooden fence, and the stockade posts which separated the Chant Lot from the Cemetery have been removed.</p>

<p>for organization of the present Board, yielding to the urgent request of his associates, he consented to serve until June; when, at his renewed request, the Trustees accepted his resignation, and Mr. I. M. Spelman was chosen President. The Trustees take this occasion to express their appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Mr. Bradlee during the three and a half years of his presidency, and their acknowledgment of the efficiency and courtesy with which he performed the duties of that office.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Trustees believe that the interests of the Proprietors require some further action in relation to the By-Laws, than that taken at the last Annual Meeting. Under the vote of the Proprietors passed July 10, 1835, the Trustees were authorized to make additional By-Laws. In accordance with this vote they have, from time to time, added to the By-Laws general regulations of the affairs of the Corporation and of their own proceedings. These, as finally codified, have been printed and distributed among the Proprietors. In this manner the By-Laws, which should, as defined by the Supreme Court, "regulate the conduct and define the duties of the members towards the Corporation, and between themselves," appear to regulate the proceedings of the Trustees, and to embarrass them in the discharge of their duties as prescribed by the charter, which gives to the Trustees the "general management, superintendence, and care of the property, expenditures, business, and prudential concerns of the Corporation, and the sale of lots in the Cemetery." So long as the Trustees were empowered by the Corporation to amend the By-Laws, as occasion might require, no practical difficulty resulted, but now that this has been</p>

<p>revoked, it seems to the Trustees desirable that the By-Laws should be revised, and the duties of the Proprietors and the Trustees more definitely stated. If the present By-Laws are to be enforced without modification in individual cases, it is certain that much inconvenience will grow out of them.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Trustees therefore recommend the appointment of a Committee of the Proprietors, to confer with them upon a revision of the By-Laws, and report at a special meeting, to be called for this purpose.<span class='line-break'> </span>For the Trustees,<span class='line-break'> </span>I.M.
