<p>"the undersigned was made by the plan, on which the lot appears to be next to lot numbered 845, that of the late Nathaniel Tracy, while on the ground it is three lots distant from it, being enclosed by a doze nor more stone posts, on one of which is cut the number 1221.</p>
<p>On the 17th November, 1845, Mr Edwin Larson purchased lot No. 1227 on Gernanium Path, which, on the plan, occupies the same locality as the lot of the petitioner occupies on the ground, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The lots 1221 and 1227 are upon the Westerly side of Geranium Path, with butone intervening lot.</p>
<p>Mr. Larson evidently improved his lot early, having erected an iron fence, and made several interments.</p>
<p>Your petitioner has no doubt that the said lots were purchased understandingly by the respective proprietors, being selected in the usual manner on the ground, and the purchasers receiving conveyances corresponding to said selection, the number of your petitioners lots being the sixth before Mr Larson's, and seventeen days earlier in date, - and thinks that an error was probably made by the surveyor in transcribing the number from the stakes at the end of the season, 1221 and 1227 nearly resembling each other. He finds that they were placed erroneously on the first (Wadsworth) plan, and have ever remained so, appearing so upon the lithograph plan of 1846, and all subsequent ones, and upon the sectional plan in the same manner.</p>

<p>A different policy from the one formerly passed, <span class='line-break'> </span>in laying out &amp; selling lots, has lately been adopted.<span class='line-break'> </span>Before that the standard size of a lot was 300 sq.feet<span class='line-break'> </span>and the sale of anything smaller was discouraged.<span class='line-break'> </span>The purchaser had to choose, excepting in rare instances, <span class='line-break'> </span>between that size &amp; a single grave in one of the public lots.<span class='line-break'> </span>Applications for smaller lots became so frequent that it <span class='line-break'> </span>seemed a necessity to meet them more promptly &amp; freely <span class='line-break'> </span>than had been till then been thought  advisable.<span class='line-break'> </span>Arrangements were therefore made to furnish lots of almost <span class='line-break'> </span>any size down to 93 sq. feet &amp; costing but $150. including <span class='line-break'> </span>the necessary deposit for its care by the Corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>the wisdom of this provision has been fully justified by the <span class='line-break'> </span>character of the sales made during the past year.  The average size <span class='line-break'> </span>of all the lots sold for the year has been 196 1/2 sq. feet.</p>

<p>The Committee have given constant &amp; careful attention <span class='line-break'> </span>to the annual care of lots for proprietors.  Their aim has <span class='line-break'> </span>been threefold.  To have the Lots kept in the most satis<span class='line-break'></span>factory condition as well to meet the expectations of <span class='line-break'> </span>individual proprietors as to produce a general effect, <span class='line-break'> </span>giving an agreeable impression when viewing he Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>as a whole.  To reduce the annual charge to the lowest <span class='line-break'> </span>possible sum.  With the hope &amp; purpose that ultimately <span class='line-break'> </span>all the lots may be entrusted to the care of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Nowithstanding every effort yet made there are <span class='line-break'> </span>still many neglected lots objects of offence in themselves <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; seriously marring the appearance of the neighborhood.<span class='line-break'> </span>Some progress has been made in securing the attention <span class='line-break'> </span>of proprietors to such lots but much still remains to be done.<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemeteries of more recent date, profiting by the experience <span class='line-break'> </span>of older ones, have provided at the outset for a sufficient <span class='line-break'> </span>deposit, in addition to the selling price, to be made when <span class='line-break'> </span>the lot is taken, for its perpetual care.  This plan awas<span class='line-break'> </span>finally adopted by the trustees on the 26^th April 1876<span class='line-break'> </span>since which no land has been sold without such deposit.<span class='line-break'> </span>The difficulty is therefore now confined to those lots <span class='line-break'> </span>sold prior to that date.  There are some lots, whose <span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors cannot be found &amp; it will be a question for <span class='line-break'> </span>the trustees to consider before long, how these  shall be cared<span class='line-break'> </span>for in the interest of the lots contigous to them &amp; sufering <span class='line-break'> </span>by their neglect.  The annual charge has from time <span class='line-break'> </span>to time been materially reduced.  For the year 1871 it was $5.<span class='line-break'> </span>for care &amp; $4 for topdressing when needed, for a lot of 300 sq. feet.</p>

And these methods<span class='line-break'> </span>will unquestionably result in the employment of the Corpo<span class='line-break'></span>-ration solely for all such work.  The Committee do not <span class='line-break'> </span>believe that any other gardeners than those employed <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Corporation should be permitted to undertake <span class='line-break'> </span>the care of Lots within the Cemetery.

<p>By far the most important duty of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Com. has been to examine &amp; decide upon estimates <span class='line-break'> </span>for deposits to be made for the perpetual care of lots and <span class='line-break'> </span>monuments or other sturctures thereon.

<p>On the 31^st Dec. 1879 the Fund stood s follows:</p>

<p>The condition of the Fund, while it seems to <span class='line-break'> </span>be quite ample for the perforance of everything <span class='line-break'> </span>undertaken, judging of the future by the ex<span class='line-break'></span>perience of the past fifty years, cannot be <span class='line-break'> </span>considered too large for extraordinary emer<span class='line-break'></span>gencies, which may be enountered fifty years <span class='line-break'> </span>or a century hence.  The guaranty given is <span class='line-break'> </span>not for a limited period but for all time.</p>
<p>The Committee have always kept in mind <span class='line-break'> </span>both parties to the contract: the single Proprietor <span class='line-break'> </span>who is making provision for the perpetual care <span class='line-break'> </span>of his Lot &amp; all the other Proprietors who are <span class='line-break'> </span>assuming that trust for him.

<p>The Committee have given no little<span class='line-break'> </span>thought to two other matters which whey will surely <span class='line-break'> </span>be pardoned for alluding to briefly at this time.</p>
<p>One is the rights of widows under the law.<span class='line-break'> </span>As understood now the widow of a deceased proprietor</p>

<p>in the absence of any other special provision has <span class='line-break'> </span>only the right of occupancy during life.  She cannot, <span class='line-break'> </span>if objected to, be appointed a representataive of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Lot.  She cannot give directions as to its care and <span class='line-break'> </span>use.  She cannot claim the right of burial in <span class='line-break'> </span>it inasmuch as her life interest, whatever that <span class='line-break'> </span>may mean, vanishes at her death. The answer <span class='line-break'> </span>now made to this is that the law is or should<span class='line-break'> </span>be well understood and the remedy, if one <span class='line-break'> </span>is desired, is in the hands of the Proprietor if <span class='line-break'> </span>any embarrassment ensues it is only his own fault.</p>
<p>The fact remains however that as often as <span class='line-break'> </span>these conditions are explained it is a surprise <span class='line-break'> </span>to the proprietor or to the widow as the case may <span class='line-break'> </span>be. The difficulty undoubtedly grews out of the <span class='line-break'> </span>confused nature of the property.  The Corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>really sells the right of burial; in a sense &amp; as an <span class='line-break'> </span>ultimate result retaining to itself the fee of the land;<span class='line-break'> </span>which at the same time an unnecessary form is <span class='line-break'> </span>adopted for the conveyance &amp; the charter expressly <span class='line-break'> </span>provides that this right shall be held as real estate.</p>
<p>The other subject referred to is the alienation <span class='line-break'> </span>of Lots after interments have been made.  Instances <span class='line-break'> </span>have come to the knowledge of the Committee where <span class='line-break'> </span>the person inheriting a lot has had the original <span class='line-break'> </span>proprietor &amp; member of his family removed therefrom <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; has sold the lot for the purpose of turning it</p>
