<p>"The Committee have carefully examined into the con<span class='line-break'></span>dition of the present Chapel and have come to the con<span class='line-break'></span>clusion that, owing to its faulty construction, it cannot<span class='line-break'> </span>be adapted to the demands of the present time without<span class='line-break'> </span>such thorough reconstruction as would involve an ex<span class='line-break'></span>pense, nearly, if not quite, equal to the cost of a new build<span class='line-break'></span>ing.

<p>They have, therefore, concluded to recommend to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Board the construction of a new Chapel, and at the same<span class='line-break'> </span>time, and in connection therewith a building for the<span class='line-break'> </span>offices of the corporation.

The<span class='line-break'> </span>reasons given in support of this request, were<span class='line-break'> </span>that although the stone was a large one for a<span class='line-break'> </span>Lot of this size, <del>the base stone covered a much larger<span class='line-break'> </span>area that the bulk presented to the eye above it</del> a considerable portion was the base stone<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; not prominent, and<span class='line-break'> </span>that the stone was low in effect, which was empha<span class='line-break'></span>sized by the steep bank which rises some ten or<span class='line-break'> </span>twelve feet immediately in the rear of the spot<span class='line-break'> </span>where it is intended that the stone be placed, and<span class='line-break'> </span>also that the locality was retired one and there<span class='line-break'> </span>were no other monuments near. Voted that the<span class='line-break'> </span>subject be referred to the Committee on Lots,<span class='line-break'> </span>with power.</p>
