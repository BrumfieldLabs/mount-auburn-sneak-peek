<p>Boston Sept 17 1843</p>
<p>My dear sir</p>
<p>After the meeting of the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>of M<sup>t</sup> Auburn yesterday, it occurred to me<span class='line-break'> </span>that the business of the committee of five would<span class='line-break'> </span>be facilitated, if you as chairman would draw<span class='line-break'> </span>up an <u>outline</u> of a report, before the com<span class='line-break'></span>mittee meet. -- A very good and unanimous<span class='line-break'> </span>opinion appeared to prevail, in regard to the<span class='line-break'> </span>improvements to be undertaken, and now, what<span class='line-break'> </span>is principally want, is an estimate of the proper <span class='line-break'> </span>division of our funds among the various objects.</p>
<p>Mr Bond, treasurer, says we should<span class='line-break'> </span>have at the end of this year, after paying for the<span class='line-break'> </span>Gate, a surplus of about $26.000. Suppose we<span class='line-break'> </span>apply the surplus somewhat in the following manner</p>
<p><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>Say, for the Iron Fence</th> <th>$10.000<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>For draining and cleaning ponds</td> <td>4.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>Hedge on 3 sides</td> <td>1.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>Chapel</td> <td>5.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>Tower</td> <td>3.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>Planting trees</td> <td>1.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>Reserve</td> <td>2.000</td> </tr> <tr><td>[total]</td> <td>26.000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> In regard to the first of these objects, I<span class='line-break'> </span>suppose that the sum of $10.000 would make the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence for the lower corner of our premises on the</p>

<p>main road all the way to the gate, and<span class='line-break'> </span>several rods beyond it, thus finishing all that<span class='line-break'> </span>part which is usually seen by visitors who ride<span class='line-break'> </span>out from Boston or Cambridge. The estimate for<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole front fence is about $18.700 of which<span class='line-break'> </span>it will be sure that 10.000 is more than half. The<span class='line-break'> </span>remaining lesser half we should be able to finish in<span class='line-break'> </span>a year or two --</p>
<p>2. For obtaining pure water we should <span class='line-break'> </span>begin a ditch or drain, at the salt marsh as low<span class='line-break'> </span>as the tide water, and continue it into Meadow Pond,<span class='line-break'> </span>thence by a channel, or culvert, into Forest, and<span class='line-break'> </span>Garden Pond, and from the latter into the meadow<span class='line-break'> </span>west of the Gate. This would enable us to drain<span class='line-break'> </span>our low grounds, &amp; drain &amp; clean out the ponds,<span class='line-break'> </span>and if, as Mr Howe thinks, we should strike springs,<span class='line-break'> </span>we might have running water, without going to<span class='line-break'> </span>Fresh Pond. But if not, this enterprise may be<span class='line-break'> </span>extended hereafter. I should think $4000. sufficient<span class='line-break'> </span>for the above purpose. Mr Coolidges consent<span class='line-break'> </span>must be obtained to a ditch through his low land<span class='line-break'> </span>near Charles River.</p>
<p>3. A Hedge is wanted on the three back<span class='line-break'> </span>sides. The principal expense would be for digging<span class='line-break'> </span>a trench &amp; filling it with soil from the ponds.<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Howe can raise the plants at a trifling cost.</p>
<p>4. A Chapel such as you propose might<span class='line-break'> </span>be erected of rough stone on some Gothic model, for<span class='line-break'> </span>less than $5000. I think. We must select some<span class='line-break'> </span>spot with sufficient unoccupied ground to be kept<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>opposite figure, the building is in black<span class='line-break'> </span>lines &amp; the prospective addition is dotted --<span class='line-break'> </span>of the shape which I understand to meet your views. Where<span class='line-break'> </span>shall it stand? -- Unfortunately some of our best sites are<span class='line-break'> </span>occupied with lots. -- In looking at the map, the most<span class='line-break'> </span>eligible spots appear to me to be. 1. Near the gate a little<span class='line-break'> </span>to the east. 2. Somewhere opposite Spurzheim monument<span class='line-break'> </span>if the ground is [b..?] enough</p>
<p>5. A Tower. I have put down 3000. for this,<span class='line-break'> </span>in case we should want to go a little higher.</p>
<p>6. Trees are to be set out on all our vacant ground,<span class='line-break'> </span>where paths are to go. Cost I think less than estimate.</p>
<p>7. Reserve $2000. This is to carry out<span class='line-break'> </span>any item which may have been underestimated.<span class='line-break'> </span>As many of our improvements need not be paid<span class='line-break'> </span>for in less than a year, we shall have another years income,<span class='line-break'> </span>say $4000. to add to this reserve.</p>
<p>Should any other improvement suggest itself as<span class='line-break'> </span>a desideration in Mount Auburn, you will be kind<span class='line-break'> </span>enough to <del>suggest</del> add it &amp; [believe me?]</p>
