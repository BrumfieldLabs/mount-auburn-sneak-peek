<p>There never was any "gardener" at <span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn. One was contemplated by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Hort. Society &amp; provided for in their act of<span class='line-break'> </span>incorporation, but no land was ever set off for that <span class='line-break'> </span>purpose. Therefore the words "cemetery &amp; garden"<span class='line-break'> </span>mean only the present cemetery.</p>
<p>There are two items of property provided<span class='line-break'> </span>for in the act under which the transfer was made.</p>
<p>1. The "garden &amp; cemetery <u>now</u> held by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Mass Horticultural Society." Section 2<sup>d</sup></p>
<p>2. "Any other lands adjacent thereto not exceeding<span class='line-break'> </span>fifty acres" &amp;c -- Section 2<sup>d</sup></p>
<p>The <u>first</u> item is afterwards continually referred<span class='line-break'> </span>to as the "said garden &amp; cemetery", or "said cemetery".<span class='line-break'> </span>The second item is continually ignored, and never<span class='line-break'> </span>referred to afterwards in the act.</p>
<p>Now if it had been the intention of the contracting<span class='line-break'> </span>parties to have [recorded?] the second item for the benefit<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Horticultural Society, they would have said <u>not</u><span class='line-break'> </span>simply the "said cemetery", but "said cemetery &amp; any other<span class='line-break'> </span>lands adjacent thereto," or "added thereto."</p>
<p>The following [equation?] will trace the thing<span class='line-break'> </span>from the end to the beginning</p>

<p>"Cemetery lots", section 10<sup>th</sup>, mean "Lots in the said cemetery"<span class='line-break'> </span>expressed in line before</p>
<p>"Said cemetery" means "The cemetery <u>now</u> held by<span class='line-break'> </span>the Mass. Horticultural Society."</p>
<p>Which means The cemetery which they sold<span class='line-break'> </span>to the present corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>under the act of the Legislature,<span class='line-break'> </span>and nothing more.</p>
<p>As to "trusts, powers" &amp;c the Horticultural Society<span class='line-break'> </span>had none to convey, having exhausted all they had, in<span class='line-break'> </span>purchasing the land for $10,000.</p>
<p>As to the "enlargement" of the cemetery this is well<span class='line-break'> </span>explained by Mr Loring. It is not named in any<span class='line-break'> </span>connexion with the Horticultural Society, but like "embellishment"<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp;c. simply related to the mode of using the funds.</p>
<p>I am satisfied without further legal advice, but<span class='line-break'> </span>consent to consult Mr Fletcher if the committee desire it.<span class='line-break'> </span>In that case the two previous arguments should be<span class='line-break'> </span>submitted to him as judge</p>
