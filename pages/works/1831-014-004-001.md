<p>Boston Sept 17 1843</p>
<p>My dear sir</p>
<p>After the meeting of the Trustees of Mt<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn yesterday, it occurred to me that the business <span class='line-break'> </span>of the committee of five would be facilitated, if you as<span class='line-break'> </span>chairman would draw up an <u>outline</u> of a report, before<span class='line-break'> </span>the commitee meet. A very good and unanimous o<span class='line-break'></span>pinion appeared to prevail, in regard to the improvements<span class='line-break'> </span>to be undertaken, and now, what we principally want, <span class='line-break'> </span>is an estimate of the proper division of our funds among <span class='line-break'> </span>the various objects.</p>
<p>Mr Bond, treasurer, says we shall have at the<span class='line-break'> </span>end of this year, after paying of the gates, a surplus of <span class='line-break'> </span>about $26,000. Suppose we apply this surplus somewhat<span class='line-break'> </span>in the following manner.</p>
<p>Say, for the Iron fence _____ $10,000</p>
<p>for drawing and cleaning ponds  _____ 4,000</p>
<p>Hedge on 3 sides _____  1,000</p>
<p>Chapel _____ 5,000</p>
<p>Tower _____ 3,000</p>
<p>Planting trees _____ 1,000</p>
<p>Reserve _____ 2,000</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>26,000</p>
<p>In regard to the first of these objects, I suppose<span class='line-break'> </span>that the sum of $10,000 would make the fence<span class='line-break'> </span>from the lower corner of our premises on the main<span class='line-break'> </span>road all the way to the gate, and several rods beyond.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>it, thus finishing all that part which is usually seen<span class='line-break'> </span>by visitors who ride out from Boston or Cambridge. The <span class='line-break'> </span>estimate for the whole front fence is about $18,100 of <span class='line-break'> </span>which it will be seen that 10,000 is more than half. <span class='line-break'> </span>The remaining lesser half we should be able to finish in <span class='line-break'> </span>a year or two.</p>
<p>2  For obtaining pure water we should begin <span class='line-break'> </span>a ditch or drain, at the salt marsh as low as the tide <span class='line-break'> </span>water, and continue it into Meadow Pond, thence by <span class='line-break'> </span>a channel, or culvert, into {Soust?], and Garden Ponds, and <span class='line-break'> </span>from the latter into the meadow west of the gate. <span class='line-break'> </span>This would enable us to drain our low grounds, and drain <span class='line-break'> </span>and clean out the ponds, and if, as Mr Howe thinks, we<span class='line-break'> </span>should strike springs, we might have running water with<span class='line-break'></span>out going to Fresh Pond. But if not this enterprise may <span class='line-break'> </span>be extended hereafter. I should think $4,000 sufficient for <span class='line-break'> </span>the above purpose. Mr [Coolige's?] consent must be obtained<span class='line-break'> </span>to a ditch through his low land near Charles river.</p>
<p>3  A Hedge is wanted on the 3 back sides. The <span class='line-break'> </span>principal expense would be for digging a trench and filling<span class='line-break'> </span>it with soil from the ponds. Mr Howe can raise the<span class='line-break'> </span>plants at a trifling cost.</p>
<p>4  A Chapel such as you propose might be erected <span class='line-break'> </span>of rough stone on some Gothic model, for less than $5,000,<span class='line-break'> </span>I think. We must select some spots with sufficient un<span class='line-break'></span>occupied ground to be kept for its prospective enlargement.<span class='line-break'> </span>In the opposite figure, the building is <span class='line-break'> </span>in black and the prospective addition<span class='line-break'> </span>is dotted of the shape which I under<span class='line-break'></span>stand to meet your views. [Image: line drawing of a cruciform plan with only the nave, or left-most rectangle, a solid line.] Where shall it stand? Unfor<span class='line-break'></span>tunately some of our best sites are occupied with lots</p>

<p>In looking at the map, the most eligible spot<span class='line-break'> </span>appears to me to be, 1. Near the gate a little to the east<span class='line-break'> </span>2.  Somewhere opposite Spurtzheim's monument if the <span class='line-break'> </span>ground is level enough.</p>
<p>5.  A Tower. I have put down 3,000 for this, in <span class='line-break'> </span>case we should want to go a little higher,.</p>
<p>6.  Trees to be set out on all out vacant ground <span class='line-break'> </span>where paths are to go. Cost I think less than estimate</p>
<p>7  Reserve $2,000 This is to carry out any item which <span class='line-break'> </span>may have been underestimated. As many of our <span class='line-break'> </span>improvements need not be paid for in less than a year, we<span class='line-break'> </span>shall have another years income, say $4,000, to add to <span class='line-break'> </span>this reserve.</p>
<p>Should any other improvement suggest itself as<span class='line-break'> </span>a desideratum in Mount Auburn, you will be kind enough <span class='line-break'> </span>to add it &amp; believe me</p>
<p>Dear sir, your friend &amp; servt.</p>
