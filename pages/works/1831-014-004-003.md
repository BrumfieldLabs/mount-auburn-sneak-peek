<p>NOTE: letter folded out so that first image  contains on right of the fold the first page of the document  and on left "page 3." Transcription will start with text left of the fold (pg3)</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>. The window sashes and glass <span class='line-break'> </span>will require occasional in<span class='line-break'></span>-spection.</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup> In the outside Iron Fence <span class='line-break'> </span>the Tenons are cemented into <span class='line-break'> </span>mortices in the Ports by means <span class='line-break'> </span>of brimstone,<sup>which</sup> <del>thereby </del> generating<span class='line-break'> </span>an acid, <del>which</del>corrodes the iron,<span class='line-break'> </span>and<del>which</del>ought to be replaced<span class='line-break'> </span>with lime-mortar on some<span class='line-break'> </span>cement of which lime forms <span class='line-break'> </span>a part.</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup> The receiving Tomb, constructed <span class='line-break'> </span>at a heavy cost, ought to produce<span class='line-break'> </span>an income.  In order to prevent <span class='line-break'> </span>the nuisance by which man other <span class='line-break'> </span>Tombs are troubled, the walls and <span class='line-break'> </span>vaults should be made unquestionably <span class='line-break'> </span>tight, unless in places provided for<span class='line-break'> </span>the abosrption of Gas.</p>

<p>To the Trustees of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mnt. Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Having been conversant for <span class='line-break'> </span>more than forty years with most <span class='line-break'> </span>of the large operations in Mount <span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn Cemetery, I am desirous <span class='line-break'> </span>to leave on file or on record some <span class='line-break'> </span>account of those construcctions which<span class='line-break'> </span>may be likely hereafter to require <span class='line-break'> </span>repairs or alterations, and which <span class='line-break'> </span>may sometimes be difficult to find,</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>  The Well which supplies the<span class='line-break'> </span>Fountains, is a few feet inside of <span class='line-break'> </span>the eastern fence.  It is dug in <span class='line-break'> </span>a quicksand, the bed of which <span class='line-break'> </span>is apparently below the bed of<span class='line-break'> </span>Charles River and is filled with <span class='line-break'> </span>springs which make the bottom<span class='line-break'> </span>turbid and throw sand into the <span class='line-break'> </span>Pipes, which scratches and othrewise</p>

<p>2<span class='line-break'> </span>damages the Steam Engine.<span class='line-break'> </span>The remedy will be to make a <span class='line-break'> </span>new and large well outside of <span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge Avenue on the East, and <span class='line-break'> </span>remove the Steam Engine to that locality - thus reserving for Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>purposes the land now occupied <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Hytdraulic Works.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>.  The Corporation have a right <span class='line-break'> </span>of drainage into Charles River <span class='line-break'> </span>through the Coolidge Lot adjoining <span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge Avenue and owned by <span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn.</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>.  The Water Pipes in Mount Auburn <span class='line-break'> </span>are mostly made of Sheet iron<span class='line-break'> </span>coated on the inside and outside <span class='line-break'> </span>with hyudraulic cement, furnished <span class='line-break'> </span>by the patentees Messrs.[?]<span class='line-break'> </span>of New York  They will probably be <span class='line-break'> </span>found to require repair sooner than <span class='line-break'> </span>if made of more durable material.<span class='line-break'> </span>Those in Frountain Arenue are</p>
<p>[right side of page:]<span class='line-break'> </span>already believed to be in a leaky <span class='line-break'> </span>condition.</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> The Reservoir which feeds the <span class='line-break'> </span>Fountains is near the top of Mnt. Auburn, and is kept full <span class='line-break'> </span>while the Engine is working, by <span class='line-break'> </span>a pipe leading towards the Tower<span class='line-break'> </span>from the West.  The Vault which <span class='line-break'> </span>covers this Resevoir <sup>(and is under the Path)</sup> should be <span class='line-break'> </span>examined at least annually for safety.</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>  The hot air flue by which the <span class='line-break'> </span>Chapel is warmed was made by <span class='line-break'> </span>cutting a pasage from the furnace<span class='line-break'> </span>ner the northern base of the bank, through the foundation wall <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Chapel to about the centre <span class='line-break'> </span>of the floor and passes dangerously <span class='line-break'> </span>near to the base of the north east <span class='line-break'> </span>columns.  It should be secured <span class='line-break'> </span>laterally bt filling the intervening <span class='line-break'> </span>space with rubble and cement.</p>
