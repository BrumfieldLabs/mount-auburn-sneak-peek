<p>Supt. of Mt. Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>We received your<span class='line-break'> </span>Account today, but think you<span class='line-break'> </span>have miscalculated the amount.</p>
<p>Your charge was $3.50<span class='line-break'> </span>per day for horse &amp; man and<span class='line-break'> </span>$2.50 per day, per man.</p>
<p>The length of hire<span class='line-break'> </span>was three hours.</p>
<p>We employed or<span class='line-break'> </span>hired two horses with teamsters<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; one labourer which I<span class='line-break'> </span>think should amount to $3.18.</p>
<p>Please reconsider it.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Smith &amp; Barrow</p>
