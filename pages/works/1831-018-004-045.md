<p>Dear Sir: --</p>
<p>While visiting the<span class='line-break'> </span>grave in St Johns Lot, of my infant<span class='line-break'> </span>daughter Annie G. Glen, some time <span class='line-break'> </span>about the year 1865 or '6, it was evi<span class='line-break'></span><date when=''>1865</date><span class='line-break'> </span><date when=''>1866</date><span class='line-break'> </span>dent to me that an interment had<span class='line-break'> </span>recently been made in it, she <span class='line-break'> </span>having died in 1852, and the<span class='line-break'> </span><date when=''>1852</date><span class='line-break'> </span>position of the new grave being<span class='line-break'> </span>different from hers, I found, on<span class='line-break'> </span>inquiring at the gate that the infant<span class='line-break'> </span>daughter of W<sup><u>m</u></sup> Parker had been<span class='line-break'> </span>bured there May 18, 1863, -- The<span class='line-break'> </span><date when=''>1863-05-18</date><span class='line-break'> </span>number of the grave being 39.<span class='line-break'> </span>The number of my grave, however,<span class='line-break'> </span>entered on the record at the office,<span class='line-break'> </span>being 67, which I suppose was the<span class='line-break'> </span>number on the original plan</p>

<p>of St John's Lot, which they stated<span class='line-break'> </span>had been accidentally destroyed,<span class='line-break'> </span>the numbers now having become<span class='line-break'> </span>quite irregular, as they now [sa..?] [thus?]<span class='line-break'> </span>in the neighborhood (where my<span class='line-break'> </span>child was buried, 44, 12, [number circled] 39, 40,<span class='line-break'> </span>75, and the original number of<span class='line-break'> </span>the grave 69 removed to opposite<span class='line-break'> </span>side of the lot. Mr Safford<span class='line-break'> </span>said that it would be necessary <span class='line-break'> </span>to dig to ascertain if my child<span class='line-break'> </span>was buried in 39, but that<span class='line-break'> </span>it was rather a delicate matter<span class='line-break'> </span>to undertake, however the<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent would decide<span class='line-break'> </span>what was to be done. And thus<span class='line-break'> </span>the matter has remained<span class='line-break'> </span>for some years until about<span class='line-break'> </span>twelve months ago, when Mr<span class='line-break'> </span><date when=''>1874-10</date><span class='line-break'> </span>Safford informed me that he<span class='line-break'> </span>had investigated the matter,<span class='line-break'> </span>and had now no doubt that<span class='line-break'> </span>my grave had been used<span class='line-break'> </span>again for the purpose of inter<span class='line-break'></span>ment, and that the Super<span class='line-break'></span>intendent proposed "that the<span class='line-break'> </span>other person should have an<span class='line-break'></span>other grave." About eight <span class='line-break'> </span>weeks ago I called to see the<span class='line-break'> </span><date when=''>1875-08-30</date><span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent. He seemed<span class='line-break'> </span>to have forgotten all about<span class='line-break'> </span>the matter, but got the clerks<span class='line-break'> </span>to take my statement, and<span class='line-break'> </span>taking my address said he<span class='line-break'> </span>would write to me, but<span class='line-break'> </span>I have not heard from him<span class='line-break'> </span>since. You will remember<span class='line-break'> </span>that I wrote to you once before<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to this matter and<span class='line-break'> </span>you desired me to let you<span class='line-break'> </span>know after a reasonable time<span class='line-break'> </span>if the matter had<sup>not</sup>been attended<span class='line-break'> </span>to.</p>
