<p>[Letterhead: Office of Superintendent Mt. Auburn Cemetery]</p>
<p>OFFICE OF<span class='line-break'> </span>SUPERINTENDENT MT. AUBURN CEMETERY,</p>
<p>P.O. CAMBRIDGE,<span class='line-break'> </span>MASS.</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Jan'y 28th 1876</p>
<p>J.M. Spelman Esq<span class='line-break'> </span>Chair. Comm on Grounds</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed is a plan which I offer as<span class='line-break'> </span>a substitute for the present plan for laying out that part<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Stone Farm between Magnolia, Swan &amp; Eagle Avenues and<span class='line-break'> </span>the Iron fence.</p>
<p>A copy of the present laying out is in your possession or at<span class='line-break'> </span>the Boston office, and the proposed changes are shown on the <span class='line-break'> </span>enclosed plan in red.</p>
<p>I consider the advantage of the proposed plan to be that<span class='line-break'> </span>the laying out conforms more nearly with the natural<span class='line-break'> </span>surface, that the means of drainage will be better, and<span class='line-break'> </span>the curved &amp; winding avenues will present a more pleasing<span class='line-break'> </span>appearance than long and straight ones.</p>
<p>As work is now underway which would be somewhat effected by<span class='line-break'> </span>this change, I should be glad to learn the decision of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Committee as soon as convenient</p>
<p>Respectfully</p>
<p>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Sup't<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
