<p>B R Curtis Esqr</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I think [no? an?] organization of the<span class='line-break'> </span>board of Trustees of Mt Auburn has been made this year.<span class='line-break'> </span>You will probably have a meeting during my absence<span class='line-break'> </span>of a few weeks &amp; I beg leave to suggest for full consider<span class='line-break'></span>ation the question which has often been agitated, of<span class='line-break'> </span>granting permits to strangers to drive into the grounds.<span class='line-break'> </span>I have been opposed to it from the difficulty of [discussion?] --<span class='line-break'> </span>[insisting?] its lessening the inducements to become Proprie<span class='line-break'></span>tors merely for the value of the privilege of introducing<span class='line-break'> </span>strangers. This last reason is becoming of less &amp; less con<span class='line-break'></span>sequence to us. The other remains in all its force -- still,<span class='line-break'> </span>cases have happened when it has been mortifying that<span class='line-break'> </span>the accommodations could not have been granted.<span class='line-break'> </span>Gov Ellsworth &amp; family is one of them.</p>
<p>If the thing is done I suppose tickets should be granted<span class='line-break'> </span>only to persons living more than 15 or 20 miles from the<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery in the City -- for a single time either for a<span class='line-break'> </span>single vehicle or for a single party. Probably it<span class='line-break'> </span>would be best that each Trustee should be supplied<span class='line-break'> </span>with them.</p>

<p>There is another topic which I beg leave to ask atten<span class='line-break'></span>tion to. It is known that the Treas<sup>r's</sup> compensation<span class='line-break'> </span>has hitherto been the use of moneys lying in his hands.<span class='line-break'> </span>Sometimes the amt has been inconsiderable &amp; I presume<span class='line-break'> </span>has fallen short on average of 2000 dolls, as I have kept<span class='line-break'> </span>well invested. My desire is to change the mode of<span class='line-break'> </span>compensation &amp; that the collection be deposited, in some<span class='line-break'> </span>Bank in the name of the Treas<sup>r</sup>, as such, from time<span class='line-break'> </span>to time The duty &amp; labor of the office have become<span class='line-break'> </span>very considerable &amp; frequent enquiries relating to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery cause much interruption to business.</p>
<p>Still the object &amp; means of the Institution may not justify<span class='line-break'> </span>the pay of a full compensation for the services rendered<span class='line-break'> </span>and if I continue as Treas<sup>r</sup> I shall submit readily to the<span class='line-break'> </span>views of the board. It may be proper that the salary<span class='line-break'> </span>commence on 1 June or July.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>George Bond</p>
<p>Otis Place 7 May 1842<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
