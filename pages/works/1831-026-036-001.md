<p>The Trustees of Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery <del>have the satisfaction</del> <sup>are gratified in being able</sup> to report<span class='line-break'> </span>that the property of the Corporation remains<span class='line-break'> </span>as heretofore in a secure and satisfactory state.</p>
<p>A considerable sum has been expended<span class='line-break'> </span><sup>during the last year</sup> on repairing, grading and paving at the sides,<span class='line-break'> </span>some of the principal avenues.  Many of the<span class='line-break'> </span><del>[?] and</del> superfluous trees have been removed, <span class='line-break'> </span>and the branches of others trimmed away, <del>giving</del> 10<span class='line-break'> </span>that the whole ground has a new finished and<span class='line-break'> </span>ornamental appearance than it <del>had heretofore</del> <span class='line-break'> </span>before [?].  Much remains still to be done in <span class='line-break'> </span>the [judiciaries?] and careful prosecution of these <span class='line-break'> </span>and similar improvements.</p>
<p>The westerly portion of Garden pond<span class='line-break'> </span>near Central avenue has justly been considered a<span class='line-break'> </span>blemish to Mount Auburn, on account of the <span class='line-break'> </span>stagnant condition of the water, and the muddings<span class='line-break'> </span>of the banks and bottom.  A contract has been <span class='line-break'> </span>made for filling up this pond with gravel <span class='line-break'> </span>from the neighboring hill for the sum of $850.<span class='line-break'> </span>The earth will be raised about six &amp; a half feet</p>

<p>above the present surface of the water, by <span class='line-break'> </span>which operation the Corporation will gain more<span class='line-break'> </span>than an acre of valuable land in one of the<span class='line-break'> </span>most eligible parts of the Cemetery.</p>
<p>Some preparatory arrangements have <span class='line-break'> </span>been made for the occupation of the Stone <span class='line-break'> </span>farm purchased last year by the Trustees.<span class='line-break'> </span>The principal avenues have been prospectively<span class='line-break'> </span>surveyed, and planted with young trees at suitable<span class='line-break'> </span>distances.  Nearly the whole of these trees were in <span class='line-break'> </span>healthy <s>&amp; growing</s> condition at the end of the summer.</p>
<p>The Chapel has been taken down as <span class='line-break'> </span>far as the [bare?] course, and <s>resurrected</s> rebuilt during<span class='line-break'> </span>the last <s>year</s> season, in a strong &amp; durable <s>and</s><span class='line-break'> </span><s>substantial</s> manner.  The blemished and insufficient<span class='line-break'> </span>stones <sup>inserted by the unfaithfulness of the contractors</sup> have been replaced with others of the proper<span class='line-break'> </span>size and appearance, and the character of the <span class='line-break'> </span>building is now in all respects satisfactory as to <span class='line-break'> </span>strength, solidity, and durability.  No changes have <span class='line-break'> </span>been made in the design except by the intro<span class='line-break'></span>duction of some additional ornament on the outside.<span class='line-break'> </span>The interior walk not being <s>yet</s> sufficiently dry <span class='line-break'> </span>the painting <sup> is</sup> <s> obliged to be</s> def<s>f</s>erred till next season.</p>

<p>The Statues <del>designed</del> <sup>intended</sup> to occupy <sup>2</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>the interior of the Chapel are all in progress<span class='line-break'> </span>under contract made with artists of high<span class='line-break'> </span>eminence in their profession.  The statue<span class='line-break'> </span>of Gov.

<p><del> Two lots owned by individuals in front<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Chapel, and which were laid out before that<span class='line-break'> </span>building was erected, have been [burdnened?] of <span class='line-break'> </span>their proprietors, by [expecting?] this for other <span class='line-break'> </span>lots fitted up for this purpose.

<p>A vote has passed the Trustees for <span class='line-break'> </span>laying out [greater?] lots of seventy five square feet<span class='line-break'> </span>each, and offering them for sale at $50. each<span class='line-break'> </span>This will accommodate a certain class of purchasers<span class='line-break'> </span>who have occasion for but small space, and at the<span class='line-break'> </span>same time <sup>will</sup> enhance the product of the land sold.</p>

<p>It will be seen by the Treasurer's<span class='line-break'> </span>report that the expenditures of the last year<span class='line-break'> </span>have <del>much</del> ^<sup>considerably</sup> exceeded those of any preceding year.<span class='line-break'> </span>This is in part owing to the payments which have<span class='line-break'> </span>become due on certain large operations <del>[which?]</del> ^<sup>such as</sup> are<span class='line-break'> </span>not likely to recur, and partly to the state of trans<span class='line-break'></span>ition between the retirement of the former superintendent<span class='line-break'> </span>and the introduction of his successor.  The Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>entertain the hope that a more economised system <span class='line-break'> </span>of labor will be introduced, and that the necessary <span class='line-break'> </span>work on the grounds will be performed by a smaller<span class='line-break'> </span>number of hands than heretofore.</p>

<p>The future security of Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>will depend on the fidelity and economy with<span class='line-break'> </span>which its affairs are administered, and ^<sup>with which</sup> its prospective plans<span class='line-break'> </span>are carried out as contemplated by its founders.<span class='line-break'> </span>It may be assumed that all the large and more<span class='line-break'> </span>expensive operations which have been kept in view <span class='line-break'> </span>since the foundation of the establishment, are now <span class='line-break'> </span>either paid or provided for.  It <del>[?]</del> only remains<span class='line-break'> </span>by a judicious and careful management of <span class='line-break'> </span>expenditures to keep the cemetery in suitable repair<span class='line-break'> </span>and ^<sup>at the same time</sup> to accummulate a fund for its perpetual preser<span class='line-break'></span>vation.  Both these objects can <del>[assuredly?]</del> easily be accom<span class='line-break'></span>plished by the exercise of a common degree of <span class='line-break'> </span>discretion and [economy?] in the management of the<span class='line-break'> </span>receipts and funds.  But on the other hand<span class='line-break'> </span>they will assuredly be defeated, if hereafter either<span class='line-break'> </span>by reckless expenditures or by improper <del>favoritism</del> appropriation,<span class='line-break'> </span>the steady accretion of a reserved fund should<span class='line-break'> </span>be prevented.</p>
<p>As nearly as it can be ^<sup>now</sup> estimated, the <span class='line-break'> </span>[?] ^<sup>eventual</sup> value of the unsold land <del>of the corporation</del> ^<sup># at Mount Auburn</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>may be assummed  at about $300,000 at <span class='line-break'> </span>present prices.  The current expenses of the <span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery may be [assumed?] at $10,000 per annum<span class='line-break'> </span>on this approximate calculation, if the whole of the <span class='line-break'> </span>unsold land should be disposed of in ten years<span class='line-break'> </span>there would remain <del>in the treasury</del> a balance</p>

<p>Mount Auburn in most respects takes<span class='line-break'> </span>precedence of <del>M</del> other cemeteries which have<span class='line-break'> </span><del>since</del> been founded in imitation of it.  The <span class='line-break'> </span>peculiar character of its natural features had attracted<span class='line-break'> </span>attention long before its <del>(present)</del> purchase [?], and the <span class='line-break'> </span>surrounding landscape now seen from the top of<span class='line-break'> </span>its highest edifice, is unserpassed in ^<sup>natural and cultivated</sup> beauty.<span class='line-break'> </span>It exceeds all similar establishments in this country <span class='line-break'> </span>in the size and durability of its <del>construction</del>[constrictions?]<span class='line-break'> </span>and ^<sup>it</sup> is about to lead, instead of following them, <span class='line-break'> </span>in the interest of its historic and monumental<span class='line-break'> </span>sculptures.
