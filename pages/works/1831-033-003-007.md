<p>The Committee on Grounds report</p>
<p>That by a vote of the Trustees passed<span class='line-break'> </span><date when='1858-03-01'>March 1 1858</date> they were authorized to expend $1000.<span class='line-break'> </span>in grading &amp; improving unsold parts of the Cemetery, also<span class='line-break'> </span>$500. in the purchase of trees, &amp; a sum not exceeding<span class='line-break'> </span>$1000. in cutting a drain &amp;c through Indian Ridge.</p>
<p>They have attended to their various duties<span class='line-break'> </span>and in prosecution of the same they have graded<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; stoned the banks of Auburn Lake (Meadow Pond)<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; built a bridge across the same &amp; an avenue<span class='line-break'> </span>round the lower half of the pond. They have<span class='line-break'> </span>also introduced trees of various sizes into the grounds<span class='line-break'> </span>and have commenced perforating Indian Ridge in<span class='line-break'> </span>response to a future drain &amp; "catacomb."</p>
<p>In these objects they have expended a sum<span class='line-break'> </span>which they <del>are confident</del> believe is in the aggregate much<span class='line-break'> </span>less than the amount approximated by the Trustees,<span class='line-break'> </span>but owing to the difficulty of keeping separate the<span class='line-break'> </span>accounts of labor, horses, materials &amp;c consistently<span class='line-break'> </span>with the economical use of those employed on the<span class='line-break'> </span>ground, they are not furnished with the details of<span class='line-break'> </span>the separate accounts.</p>
