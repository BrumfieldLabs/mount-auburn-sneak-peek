<p>Mrs Mary Hemenway by her<span class='line-break'> </span>communication dated <date when='1862-11-06'>Nov 6, 1862</date> appears to<span class='line-break'> </span>pay to the Corporation of Mount Auburn cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>six thousand dollars if they will construct a<span class='line-break'> </span>fountain opposite her lot on Thistle path, and<span class='line-break'> </span>convey to her in trust to be forever kept open<span class='line-break'> </span>about 21,095 feet <sup>of land</sup> exclusive of water, as seen<span class='line-break'> </span>in a plan of the same drawn by Messrs Shad<span class='line-break'> </span>and Edison. This land is comprised chiefly of a<span class='line-break'> </span>wet bog, and a very steep bank, neither of<span class='line-break'> </span>them convertible to cemetery purposes without a<span class='line-break'> </span><del>great</del> large outlay for filling <sup>up</sup> and altering the<del>ir</del> grade.<span class='line-break'> </span>The number of lots which could be constructed in<span class='line-break'> </span>this land would not exceed 35 by Mr Shads<span class='line-break'> </span>estimate, and these would perhaps be the last<span class='line-break'> </span>part of Mount Auburn to come into the market.<span class='line-break'> </span>Supposing them to be all sold in 20 or 25 years<span class='line-break'> </span>at present full prices, they would not bring the <span class='line-break'> </span>accumulated value of $3000. paid at the<span class='line-break'> </span>present time</p>
<p>As to the cost of constructing the<span class='line-break'> </span>fountain, if it is found on experiment that we<span class='line-break'> </span>can afford to waste the water after it is used</p>

<div class="page-content">
<p>the fountain can be made for $1500. But<span class='line-break'> </span>if the water is saved and returned to the<span class='line-break'> </span>well, the whole cost <del>for</del> including laid pipes and a<span class='line-break'> </span>water tight basin would not exceed $3500.<span class='line-break'> </span>according to the items furnished by Mr Shads<span class='line-break'> </span>estimate</p>
<p>The land which is by covenant to<span class='line-break'> </span>be kept open <sup>forever,</sup> is the smallest amount which<span class='line-break'> </span>would allow the fountain to be seen to any<span class='line-break'> </span>advantage. Indeed if half as much more<span class='line-break'> </span>land were added, it would increase the beauty <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mount Auburn, and add to the desirableness<span class='line-break'> </span>of the surrounding lots which will be prepared<span class='line-break'> </span>for sale.</p>
<p>The works being already made for<span class='line-break'> </span>running two fountains, a third fountain can<span class='line-break'> </span>be carried on with the same works, for an<span class='line-break'> </span>additional expense in coal, labor and repairs<span class='line-break'> </span>not probably exceeding $100. per annum</p>
<p>for this Committee</p>
