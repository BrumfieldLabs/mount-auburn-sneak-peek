<p><date when='1867-03-12'>Boston March. 12. 1867</date></p>
<p>The committee on Grounds to whom<span class='line-break'> </span>was referred the question of warming the Chapel,<span class='line-break'> </span>beg leave to report</p>
<p>It has been desired by the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>that funerals should <sup>not</sup> take place at Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>in the cold season, either inside or outside of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Chapel on account of the exposure <del>to</del> of the friends and <del>the</del><span class='line-break'> </span>the officiating clergymen to a temperature <del>and [extremeness?]</del><span class='line-break'> </span>which may be injurious to <del>their</del> health. <sup>No provision has therefore been made for warming the chapel.</sup> And although<span class='line-break'> </span>a small flue is constructed in the north wall<sup>of the building</sup>, capable<span class='line-break'> </span>of receiving a stove pipe, it has never been used,<span class='line-break'> </span>because families and friends <del>naturally</del> preferred that<span class='line-break'> </span>funeral ceremonies should take place in <sup>the</sup> more suitable<span class='line-break'> </span>and convenient shelter of dwelling houses.</p>
<p>But the increasing number of burials in<span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn, involving a proportionate number of<span class='line-break'> </span>strangers and of others whom friends may desire that the<del>ir</del><span class='line-break'> </span>obsequies should be conducted within the chapel, has<span class='line-break'> </span>caused your committee <del>to</del> on mature consideration to<span class='line-break'> </span>believe that the time has arrived when a suitable<span class='line-break'> </span>outlay should be made for rendering the building warm<span class='line-break'> </span>and dry for occasional use, when application is<span class='line-break'> </span>made for its occupation in cold weather.</p>

<p>There are three methods in which<span class='line-break'> </span>the proposed object of warming the building may<span class='line-break'> </span>be effected.</p>
<p>1. By placing a common iron stove and<span class='line-break'> </span>pipe in the body of the house, discharging its smoke<span class='line-break'> </span>into the flue now existing.</p>
<p>2 By digging a cellar under the floor<span class='line-break'> </span>and constructing a furnace in the usual way, with<span class='line-break'> </span>smoke pipes, hot air flues and registers</p>
<p>3. By building a furnace<sup>outside</sup>, near the<span class='line-break'> </span>bottom of the high bank a few rods north of the<span class='line-break'> </span>chapel, having its own chimney, distant and separate<span class='line-break'> </span>from the building, and having its hot air conducted<span class='line-break'> </span>by underground pipes into such part of the <del>building</del> chapel<span class='line-break'> </span>as may be thought proper</p>
<p>The two first modes the committee<span class='line-break'> </span>deem objectionable on account of the chance of<span class='line-break'> </span>occasional smoking, and more particularly on account<span class='line-break'> </span>of the probable blackening of the outside wall by the<span class='line-break'> </span>discharge of smoke from the top of the flue.</p>
<p>The committee therefore recommend that<span class='line-break'> </span>the third method <sup>be adopted,</sup> as being the most convenient, safe<span class='line-break'> </span>and economical. A furnace should be built, as near<span class='line-break'> </span>as practicable to Lawn avenue, and as much as<span class='line-break'> </span>ten or fifteen feet below the level of the Chapel<span class='line-break'> </span>floor. A short chimney should be erected, covered<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>a turncap or cover to assist the escape of the<span class='line-break'> </span>smoke, but which should be so attached as<span class='line-break'> </span>to be removable during the warm <del>weather</del> season.<span class='line-break'> </span>A slant or ascending pipe or flue should be<span class='line-break'> </span>carried up from the hot air chamber of the furnace<span class='line-break'> </span>into the chapel through its floor, at such place<span class='line-break'> </span>or places as might be found convenient.</p>
<p>It is known that heat may be<span class='line-break'> </span>carried in this manner to any desirable distance,<span class='line-break'> </span>as is seen in various manufactories, conservatories<span class='line-break'> </span>and other [economical?] establishments.
