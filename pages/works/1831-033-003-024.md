<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Mr McDonald<span class='line-break'> </span>had his men all ready to move<span class='line-break'> </span>his Marble Shop on to his own<span class='line-break'> </span>land opposite the Gate. Yesterday<span class='line-break'> </span>morning, when he came &amp; offered<span class='line-break'> </span>his shop to the Trustees for<span class='line-break'> </span>"Four hundred Dollars, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees to cancel the Lease"</p>
<p>I said to him, "I have no<span class='line-break'> </span>authority to bargain". I will<span class='line-break'> </span>report to the Committee".</p>
<p>His offer <u>to the Board</u><span class='line-break'> </span>was $450.00 -- and keep his<span class='line-break'> </span>unexpired Lease a sum between<span class='line-break'> </span>six and seven Years at $100<sup><u>00</u></sup><span class='line-break'> </span>per year. So it seems he takes off<span class='line-break'> </span>(or offers too) $50<sup><u>00</u></sup> If you will cancel<span class='line-break'> </span>the Lease. Very Respectfully</p>
<p>Daniel L. Winsor</p>

<p>Boston, <date when='1869-06-07'>June 7th 1869</date></p>
<p>To the Trustees of the Cemetery of Mount Auburn.</p>
<p>Gentlemen: --</p>
<p>Being desirous to concen<span class='line-break'></span>trate all my business at the place pur<span class='line-break'></span>chased by me opposite Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Gate, it is my purpose either to sell the<span class='line-break'> </span>building occupied as my old marble<span class='line-break'> </span>Shop on land leased to me by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation, or to remove it from said<span class='line-break'> </span>land.</p>
<p>Learning the the Corporation may<span class='line-break'> </span>possibly find a use for the building, I<span class='line-break'> </span>submit to your board the first offer<span class='line-break'> </span>for sale. I am willing to sell for what<span class='line-break'> </span>the materials cost me -- say four hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>and fifty dollars -- or for what a disinterested<span class='line-break'> </span>person selected by the Board will say the<span class='line-break'> </span>materials are worth. The structure cost<span class='line-break'> </span>me about eight hundred dollars, in<span class='line-break'> </span>times when materials and labor were<span class='line-break'> </span>at lower rates.</p>
<p>I wish to act in the matter at once,<span class='line-break'> </span>as the building movers are now engaged<span class='line-break'> </span>in removing the Old Wyeth House,</p>
