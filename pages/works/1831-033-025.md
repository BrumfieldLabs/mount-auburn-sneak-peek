<p>The Committee for building a "Reception House"<span class='line-break'> </span>request leave to report progress.</p>
<p>Last November, the Committee employed <span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup>r.</sup>N. J. Bradley - architect to make designs<span class='line-break'> </span>and plans for a suitable Building, and <span class='line-break'> </span>to obtain tenders for the building of the <span class='line-break'> </span>same.  From the six Tenders sub<span class='line-break'></span>mitted the Committee <sup>they</sup>-after consulting <span class='line-break'> </span>with the architect - accepted that of Mr<span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup>c</sup>Culrdy, and <sup>a</sup>contract was made with <span class='line-break'> </span>him to complete the work according to <span class='line-break'> </span>the designs, and specifications of the architect,<span class='line-break'> </span>on or before the 15 May, for the sum of <span class='line-break'> </span>$4325 forty three hundred and twenty five <span class='line-break'> </span>dollars.  This contract refers to the super<span class='line-break'></span>structure.

<p>The Fence under direction of the Fence sur<span class='line-break'> </span>-veyor, was placed half upon our boundary <span class='line-break'> </span>line, and half upon our neighbors, but for <span class='line-break'> </span>fear of future trouble, or litigation, the Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>ordered it placed entirely upon the Corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>land.  There remains yet, to make a<span class='line-break'> </span>connection witgh the pipes of the Cambridge<span class='line-break'> </span>Water Co. who have been delayed on account <span class='line-break'> </span>of Iron pipes.  We are assured that they will <span class='line-break'> </span>soon be enabled to furnish all the water required.</p>
<p>The Committee had on orders to Lease the <span class='line-break'> </span>building, but requested the Secty to advertise it,<span class='line-break'> </span>and request the applicants to call upon him.<span class='line-break'> </span>He will report to the Board.  Two parties <span class='line-break'> </span>applied to the Committee (their application,<span class='line-break'> </span>herewith presented).  That of [Harrington?] for <span class='line-break'> </span>$600 is worth your attention, as the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee on Grounds do not require the cellar<span class='line-break'> </span>during the summer.  The others are for a <span class='line-break'> </span>Refreshment room, and are well recommended.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Committee have not yet the architects Report<span class='line-break'> </span>but<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
