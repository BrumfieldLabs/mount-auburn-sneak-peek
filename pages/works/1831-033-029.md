<p>Nath. J. Bradlee, Esq.<span class='line-break'> </span>Comm. on Greenhouses,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In accordance with<span class='line-break'> </span>your request I have collected some<span class='line-break'> </span>materials for an estimate for a new<span class='line-break'> </span>Greenhouse. Of course<span class='line-break'> </span>it is impossible to estimate the exact<span class='line-break'> </span>cost without detailed plans.</p>
<p>But I estimate the<span class='line-break'> </span>capacity of our present Greenhouses<span class='line-break'> </span>at 25,000 to 30,000 plants. We<span class='line-break'> </span>need more room for 40,000 plants.</p>
<p>I think a <u>new</u><span class='line-break'> </span>house or houses to furnish 40,000<span class='line-break'> </span>plants will cost at least $10,000.</p>
<p>Our present houses are<span class='line-break'> </span>now all in good repair, or very nearly <span class='line-break'> </span>so.  The "addition" so called<span class='line-break'> </span>about which I wrote the trustees, is really </p>

<p>not an "addition" but a part of a<span class='line-break'> </span>large new house, which will sooner<span class='line-break'> </span>or later, I suppose be built.</p>
<p>The only good ground for <span class='line-break'> </span>a house, I suppose, is that partly<span class='line-break'> </span>occupied by present houses; and<span class='line-break'> </span>it would be too late to take them<span class='line-break'> </span>down <u>this year</u>, as we could not<span class='line-break'> </span>easily get a new one done in time to<span class='line-break'> </span>take their place before frost.</p>

<p>As far as I can ascertain or<span class='line-break'> </span>judge, a large house should occu<span class='line-break'></span>py the place shown in red ink,<span class='line-break'> </span>and if we build the west end of the<span class='line-break'> </span>space now, it will all come in play<span class='line-break'> </span>by and by, as a part of a new and<span class='line-break'> </span>large building.</p>
<p>Our present houses will<span class='line-break'> </span>be so good when repaired, (now nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>done.) I think you would think them<span class='line-break'> </span>too good to throw away.</p>
<p>The following is approximately<span class='line-break'> </span><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>House of</th> <th>will hold</th> <th>will cost<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>3,000 sq. ft area</td> <td>12,000 plants</td> <td>$3,000.00</td> </tr> <tr><td>5,000 [sq. ft area]</td> <td>14,000 [plants]</td> <td>4,500. </td> </tr> <tr><td>10,000 [sq. ft area]</td> <td>30,000  [plants]</td> <td>8,000. </td> </tr> <tr><td>14.000 [sq. ft area]</td> <td>40,000 [plants]</td> <td>10,000. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> We have now got room<span class='line-break'> </span>for about 30,000 plants, and the pro<span class='line-break'></span>posed addition can be built in the ^<sup>early</sup> winter,<span class='line-break'> </span>by our own men.</p>
