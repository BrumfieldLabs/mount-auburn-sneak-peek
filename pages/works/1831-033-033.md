<p>John T. Bradlee, Esq.<span class='line-break'> </span>Pres't Mt. Auburn.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<span class='line-break'> </span>I have long<span class='line-break'> </span>thought it (underlined-) might be good policy for<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn to erect some small<span class='line-break'> </span>houses (a few) on their vacant land<span class='line-break'> </span>to be rented toa  few of the most<span class='line-break'> </span>exemplary of their employees or<span class='line-break'> </span>foremen.</p>
<p>It is not easy<span class='line-break'> </span>to get boarded (inserted above-) or to hire a house around here, and altho'<span class='line-break'> </span>land can be brought readily in (underlined[) some<span class='line-break'> </span>(underlined-) neighborhoods, yet those <span class='line-break'> </span>neighborhoods will not suit some of our best men.</p>
<p>There is no doubt<span class='line-break'> </span>such houses could be all once rented at<span class='line-break'> </span>10 per cent or more on their cost.</p>

<p>one such house this season (inserted above-) (at not over $1,000) on the<span class='line-break'> </span>Stone Meadow Lot; with a view<span class='line-break'> </span>to teh protection of our movable<span class='line-break'> </span>property on said lot, which I hope<span class='line-break'> </span>will increase; at least, I am de<span class='line-break'> </span>sirous of moving certain things<span class='line-break'> </span>over there, by degrees, which now<span class='line-break'> </span>encumber the grounds.</p>
<p>My reason for bringing<span class='line-break'> </span>the matter forwad (underlined-) now is, that if<span class='line-break'> </span>it were to be done this year, I should<span class='line-break'> </span>like to begin it (underlined-) now; as I should<span class='line-break'> </span>have an occupant for it by mid<span class='line-break'></span>summer.</p>
<p>The building<span class='line-break'> </span>it would be done entirely outside our<span class='line-break'> </span>other work.</p>
