<p>Mount Auburn,<span class='line-break'> </span>March 8th, 1871.</p>
<p>To the Trustees of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn Cemetery,</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>There is a large <span class='line-break'> </span>area of vacant land near the<span class='line-break'> </span>Engine House which is very nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>graded and ready for sale; and<span class='line-break'> </span>which would sell readily, were it<span class='line-break'> </span>not for the rubbish heaps which now<span class='line-break'> </span>encumber the spot.</p>
<p>These rubbish heaps<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot very well be got rid of as<span class='line-break'> </span>long as our carpenter work (making<span class='line-break'> </span>of coffins, repair of wagons, &amp;c.) is<span class='line-break'> </span>done near that spot.</p>
<p>To the end of get<span class='line-break'></span>ting rid of this rubbish, and thereby<span class='line-break'> </span>facilitating the sale of these lots,<span class='line-break'> </span>I would respectfully recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>the removing of the carpenter's <u>work</u><span class='line-break'> </span>over to the Stone Meadow; Enclosing<span class='line-break'> </span>a part of it with a not very heavy<span class='line-break'> </span>fence, and building a small car<span class='line-break'></span>penter's shop there.</p>
<p>The present car<span class='line-break'></span>penter's shop will be needed where<span class='line-break'> </span>it now is for a blacksmith's shop,</p>

<p>and for storing tools; for neither<span class='line-break'> </span>of which is there now proper<span class='line-break'> </span>accommodation.</p>
<p>The present black<span class='line-break'></span>smith's shop, (which needs raising<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; rebuilding,) will be needed<span class='line-break'> </span>for a coal house for the Engine;<span class='line-break'> </span>thus getting rid of the present<span class='line-break'> </span>unsightly coal-pile</p>
<p>The present buildings<span class='line-break'> </span>are gothic in style, and correspond<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Engine House, and are there<span class='line-break'></span>fore fitted to remain in and near<span class='line-break'> </span>their present position.</p>
<p>By enclosing them<span class='line-break'> </span>with a hedge, (the material for<span class='line-break'> </span>which we have already on hand,)<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole place will become neat and attractive, and the lots, now<span class='line-break'> </span>unsaleable, will go off rapidly.<span class='line-break'> </span>About $10,000 worth of land will<span class='line-break'> </span>thus be brought into market at<span class='line-break'> </span>very slight expense.</p>
<p>The cost of the<span class='line-break'> </span>new carpenter's shop I estimate<span class='line-break'> </span>at (carried over) $500</p>

<p>Very respectfully</p>
<p>C.W. Folsom, Supt.</p>
<p>P.S. The engine-house itself is not at all<span class='line-break'> </span>objectionable; it is a tasteful building, and noise<span class='line-break'></span>less. The blacksmith's shop will<span class='line-break'> </span>be no objection, as that is mostly used<span class='line-break'> </span>in the winter, when no one is about.</p>
<p>The above changes will remove<span class='line-break'> </span>all objectionable features, and the land will<span class='line-break'> </span>sell as high as any land in a correspond<span class='line-break'></span>ing part of Mt. Auburn.</p>
