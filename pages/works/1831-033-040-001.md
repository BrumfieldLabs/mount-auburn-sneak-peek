<p>J.T. Bradlee Esq<sup>re</sup></p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There is an offer<span class='line-break'> </span>from certain heirs of Stone to<span class='line-break'> </span>sell to Mount Auburn about fourteen<span class='line-break'> </span>acres of land adjoining the western<span class='line-break'> </span>side of the Cemetery, as I understand<span class='line-break'> </span>it, for about $30,000. I will thank you<span class='line-break'> </span>to communicate this fact to<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees at their next meeting.<span class='line-break'> </span>I enclose my own views on the<span class='line-break'> </span>general subject which I will<span class='line-break'> </span>thank you to make known to<span class='line-break'> </span>them at the same time</p>
<p>Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>and truly yrs</p>

<p>Mount Auburn Cemetery is already a wealthy<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation. Beside its unsold land the surplus product of<span class='line-break'> </span>which has  hitherto more than paid its ordinary annual<span class='line-break'> </span>expenses, it has accumulated in its permanent fund, more<span class='line-break'> </span>than $115 000 besides a present unappropriated balance of<span class='line-break'> </span>about $31,000. In two or three years the whole income of this<span class='line-break'> </span>capital, besides the proceeds of sales of land, will be at the<span class='line-break'> </span>disposal of the Trustees amounting to at least $10,000 per annum.</p>
<p>A question arises, what will the Trustees do with this<span class='line-break'> </span>income?</p>
<p>By the terms of the acts of the Legislatuire, we can only<span class='line-break'> </span>expend this income for two objects, one of which is for the<span class='line-break'> </span>enlargement of the Cemetery. The other for preserving</p>

<p>improving and embellishing the same.  The first of these <span class='line-break'> </span>objects is believed to have already been carried to as great an <span class='line-break'> </span>extent as can ever be desirable to a Corporation having but one <span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent and one Board of Trustees.  If an illustration <span class='line-break'> </span>of this truth were necessary it could be best be realized by <span class='line-break'> </span>purchasing for this purpose the adjacent Catholic Cemetery,<span class='line-break'> </span>a procedure which might possible gratify the feelings of both <span class='line-break'> </span>parties interested in the transacton.   The Catholic would be <span class='line-break'> </span>relieved of the care and expense of keeping  their Cemetery in <span class='line-break'> </span>order, while Mount Auburn would enjoy the distinction of <span class='line-break'> </span>being the largest Cemetery in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The recent purchase of the Watriss lot was desirable<span class='line-break'> </span>on account of its conspicuous situation and possible future <span class='line-break'> </span>inconvenience to Mount Auburn if left in other hands.  The six<span class='line-break'> </span>thousand dollars which were paid for this estate will probably <span class='line-break'> </span>never be returend from it to the Corporation.  The expense of <span class='line-break'> </span>properly enclosing this land, of which we have already had some </p>

<p>experience, will be heavy, while the land itself is a barren <span class='line-break'> </span>sand-heap on which even the grass refused to grow.  Before sods<span class='line-break'> </span>can be made to live upon it, it must be duly covered with <span class='line-break'> </span>a stratum of new soil, and before roads can be made<span class='line-break'> </span>through it, a bed of stones and gravel must be deposited there.<span class='line-break'> </span>The lots will have to be sold at low prices, and it is possible <span class='line-break'> </span>that every twenty lots sold at half price would divert an <span class='line-break'> </span>equivalent of ten whole price purchases from the old Cemetery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the old Cemeatery is abundantly <span class='line-break'> </span>sufficient for the wants of the present and probably of the next<span class='line-break'> </span>generation.  A person cannot walk by its Avenues from the <span class='line-break'> </span>eastern to the western boundary, or from the northrn to the <span class='line-break'> </span>southgern, without performing a distance of more than half <span class='line-break'> </span>a mile.  The number of paths and avenues, made and re<span class='line-break'></span>-quired already exceeds one hundred and fifty, the collective <span class='line-break'> </span>length of which is more than twenty miles, and which are <span class='line-break'> </span>preposterously expected to be kept in repair by the limited</p>
