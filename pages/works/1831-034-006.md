<p>The Com<sup>ee</sup> appointed to inquire into the <span class='line-break'> </span>charges made by W<sup>m</sup> Ward Esq against Mr Hyde the <span class='line-break'> </span>Gate Keeper at the M<sup>t</sup> Auburn, have had on hearing of the <span class='line-break'> </span>parties &amp; beg leave to <u>report</u></p>
<p>That in relation to the first charge of the refusal to <span class='line-break'> </span>admit Mr Wards carriage, Mr Ward seemed to be <span class='line-break'> </span>aware that he was not entitled to enter the grounds <span class='line-break'> </span>with his carriage, &amp; complained, not so much of his ex<span class='line-break'> </span>clusion, as of the manner in which it was done.  It<span class='line-break'> </span>apeared in evidence that Mr. Ward represented the <span class='line-break'> </span>hack as a carriage belonging to Mr. Hensham, but [their?]<span class='line-break'> </span>no ticket, &amp; on being refused entrance, threatened that <span class='line-break'> </span>he "would make trouble" for Mr Hyude, for present  &amp; past <span class='line-break'> </span>offences.  Mr Ward had no right to drive into the <span class='line-break'> </span>gates, &amp; was very properly excluded.  It is not impro<span class='line-break'></span>bable that Mr Hyde finding that an imposition <span class='line-break'> </span>was aoaut to be practiced upon him, &amp; supposing<span class='line-break'> </span>that Mr Ward would order the carriage to be driven <span class='line-break'> </span>in, shut the gate with, what appeared to Mr Ward,<span class='line-break'> </span>an "offensive allacrity,"  but it does not appear<span class='line-break'> </span>to your committee that it was done "in a manner<span class='line-break'> </span>rude, cruel &amp; uncalled for "or that any blame <span class='line-break'> </span>attached to Mr Hyde on that occasion</p>

<p>The next charge is in the opinion of your Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>one of a more serious character.  Mr Ward states that <span class='line-break'> </span>he had from time to time given the gate keeper money, <u>on<span class='line-break'> </span>leaving the cemetery.</u>  This Mr Hyde<sup>does</sup> not deny but says <span class='line-break'> </span>that not infrequently money is thrown to him by persons <span class='line-break'> </span>leaving the grounds, but denies that he ever ever received money <span class='line-break'> </span>for admission.  In the opinion of your Com<sup>ee</sup> the receiving <span class='line-break'> </span>of money at the gate <u>at any time</u>, is highly improper, &amp; should <span class='line-break'> </span>be discontinued.  Mr Ward however is the last person  who <span class='line-break'> </span>should complain "that he does not come into court with clean<span class='line-break'> </span>hands,"  he attempted a bribery &amp; then complains that <span class='line-break'> </span>it has not succeeded, &amp; that he did not succeed<span class='line-break'> </span>is an evidence of the honesty of the gate Keeper.  This <span class='line-break'> </span>practice your Com<sup>ee</sup> are of  opinion should be discontinued<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; have recommended to Mr Hyde to pay over to Mr Howe<span class='line-break'> </span>any money so received, which recommendation your Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>propose should be confirmed by the Trustees.  Mr. Hyde <span class='line-break'> </span>states that the money thrown to him by persons passing <span class='line-break'> </span>out amounts to about $10 - annual.</p>
<p>The third charge viz. the refusal to allow the daughter<span class='line-break'> </span>of Mr Hensham to carry in flowers to place upon the grave <span class='line-break'> </span>of their mother, does not appear to apply to Mr Hyde<span class='line-break'> </span>if done at all, it must have been done by some one in <span class='line-break'> </span>the temporary custody of the gate.  Mr Hyde had no</p>

<p>recollection of any such occurance.  In conclusion <span class='line-break'> </span>your C om<sup>ee</sup> believe Mr Hyude, though an [?] person,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; [?] perhaps to take offence<sup>unnessarily</sup>at the treatment he some<span class='line-break'> </span>times receives, to be a faithful &amp; honest Keeper of the Gate <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; they ask to be discharged from any further considera<span class='line-break'> </span>tion of the charages against him.</p>
<p>In relation to the Rules &amp; Regulatiosn your Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>have no alteration to propse, but they would recom<span class='line-break'> </span>mend that they should be published with the signature<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Secretary in three of the news papers printed <span class='line-break'> </span>in Boston, for the information of the Public.</p>
<p>Your Com<sup>ee</sup>deem this a favourable oppor<span class='line-break'> </span>tunity to draw the attention of the Trustees to the <span class='line-break'> </span>the Branch Rail Road now in the process of con<span class='line-break'> </span>struction to Watertown.  Your Com<sup>ee</sup>are informed<span class='line-break'> </span>that it is the intention of the proprietors to establish <span class='line-break'> </span>a station <sup>near</sup>the N. W. corner of the cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; not far from the gates, for the accommodation of the <span class='line-break'> </span>great concourse of visitors which it is anticipated <span class='line-break'> </span>will thus be brought to Mt Auburn.  It is to be feared<span class='line-break'> </span>that the grounds will be overrun by crowds of persons,<span class='line-break'> </span>who will make it a [?place] resort for pleasure &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>amusement, &amp; thus disturb the the sacred quiet of the <span class='line-break'> </span>place.   Your Com<sup>ee</sup> are not prepared, nor<span class='line-break'> </span>is it any part of their duty, to recommend any <span class='line-break'> </span></p>
