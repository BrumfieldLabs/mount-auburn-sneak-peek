<p>The subscribers appointed as a<span class='line-break'> </span>committee of the Trustees of Mount Auburn, to<span class='line-break'> </span>inquire and report on the practibility of<span class='line-break'> </span>introducing water into the grounds of the Corporation,<span class='line-break'> </span>respectfully reports.</p>
<p>That they have employed Mr Waldo<span class='line-break'> </span>Higginson as a surveyor to take the levels between<span class='line-break'> </span>the surface of Fresh Pond and that of different places<span class='line-break'> </span>in Mount Auburn and the intervening land, and have<span class='line-break'> </span>obtained from him the following results</p>
<p>The surface of Fresh pond at its<span class='line-break'> </span>ordinary summer level is about one foot above<span class='line-break'> </span>that of the tide at high water</p>
<p>The water in the meadow west of the<span class='line-break'> </span>gate was found July 27<sup>th</sup> to be eight feet 35/100 above<span class='line-break'> </span>the level of Fresh pond; and the level of Garden<span class='line-break'> </span>pond six feet and 85/100 above the level of Fresh pon</p>
<p>Two methods are practicable, by which<span class='line-break'> </span>the water of Fresh pon may be conveyed within<span class='line-break'> </span>the inclosure of Mount Auburn</p>
<p>1. The water may be raised by a <span class='line-break'> </span>steam engine, or other power, to a reservoir on</p>

<p>some eminence near Fresh pond, from whence<span class='line-break'> </span>it may be conducted in pipes, on in a channel,<span class='line-break'> </span>through the next eligible part of the intervening land<span class='line-break'> </span>to Mount Auburn - The expense of erecting and<span class='line-break'> </span>keeping in repair the machinery necessary to afford<span class='line-break'> </span>a considerable stream of water, together with the<span class='line-break'> </span>other parts of the construction, would probably be<span class='line-break'> </span>found so great as to prevent the Trustees from<span class='line-break'> </span>entertaining this project.</p>
<p>2. A deep channel might be cut,<span class='line-break'> </span>a foot or more below the level of Fresh pond,<span class='line-break'> </span>passing through the intermediate ridge to J. Wyeths<span class='line-break'> </span>meadow, and entering the cemetery a few roads<span class='line-break'> </span>west of the gate, thence passing through Garden &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>Meadow ponds, and crossing in its way Central<span class='line-break'> </span>avenue and Indian ridge, and terminating in the<span class='line-break'> </span>salt marsh southereasterly from Mount Auburn.</p>
<p>The expense of such a work according to the <span class='line-break'> </span>accompanying estimates of Mrs Higginson is as follows</p>
<p>Cost of excavation from Fresh Pond to M<sup>T</sup> Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>inclusion of crossing Wyeths meadow &amp; Watertown road $4,194.</p>
<p>Cost of excavation through M<sup>t</sup> Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; thence to Charles river marsh - - - 2064.</p>
<p>Continguous &amp; superintend - - 313.</p>
<p>Total cost by Mr Higginson estimate $6571.</p>
<p>To which may be added $700. in case a stone<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] is laid through Mr J.C. Grays ridge, -1400<span class='line-break'> </span>and $700 as a [?] estimate for land</p>
<p>Total $7971.</p>

<p>The expense of a deep channel like that<span class='line-break'> </span>just described may appear a serious objection<span class='line-break'> </span>to the undertaking. But on examination it will<span class='line-break'> </span>be found to be not so much an expense, as<span class='line-break'> </span>an investment, likely to repay, within a period, not<span class='line-break'> </span>very distant, the whole sum expended, with large<span class='line-break'> </span>interest.</p>
<p>It has not escaped the notice of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees, that the rapid manner in which the<span class='line-break'> </span>Lots in Mount Auburn are taken up, is likely<span class='line-break'> </span>before a great number of years have past, to cause<span class='line-break'> </span>the occupation, or sale, of all the disposable land<span class='line-break'> </span>now owned by the corporation. The same conside<span class='line-break'></span>ration has caused the proprietors of the lands<span class='line-break'> </span>adjacent, to hold them at the exorbitent price.<span class='line-break'> </span>Now it is found by a survey and estimate, that there<span class='line-break'> </span>are within the inclosure of Mount Auburn about<span class='line-break'> </span>eight acres of swamp, wet meadow &amp; innundated<span class='line-break'> </span>hollows wholly unfit for the purposes of sculpture.<span class='line-break'> </span>If these portions were intersected by a deep channel<span class='line-break'> </span>like the one now proposed, they would at once<span class='line-break'> </span>be converted into upland. And if the earth and<span class='line-break'> </span>gravel removed by the excavations, were thrown<span class='line-break'> </span>upon them in the [?] <del>hereafter</del> proposed, they would<span class='line-break'> </span>be [received?] two additional feet, and being thus eight feet, or<span class='line-break'> </span>more above the water level, they would be among the<span class='line-break'> </span>most eligible parts of the cemetery</p>

<p>An acre of land contains 43,560 square<span class='line-break'> </span>feet. A Lot at Mount Auburn contains 300<span class='line-break'> </span>square feet. The former sum divided by the<span class='line-break'> </span>latter gives 145, the number of lots in an acre -<span class='line-break'> </span>Throw away half this for paths and passage ways,<span class='line-break'> </span>and it leaves 72 lots in each acre, which at $100.<span class='line-break'> </span>per lot, (the present price of selected lots) given 7200.<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars as the value of each acre. Suppose that<span class='line-break'> </span>three acres are given up for ponds and channels,<span class='line-break'> </span>it will leave five acres, which at the above<span class='line-break'> </span>named price will be worth $36.000, in return<span class='line-break'> </span>for the outlay proposed.</p>
<p>The objects [attained?] in an ornamental<span class='line-break'> </span>point of view by the proposed operation, will be<span class='line-break'> </span>the introduction of a constant stream of pure water,<span class='line-break'> </span>flowing over a gravelly bed through any parts of the<span class='line-break'> </span>ground to which it may be though proper to conduct<span class='line-break'> </span>it, interspersed with ponds of the same description,<span class='line-break'> </span>- in the place of the present stagnant, impure<span class='line-break'> </span>and muddy pools, which in dry seasons become nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>or quite exhausted of water</p>
<p>Should the project now proposed be<span class='line-break'> </span>favorably entertained by the Trustees, there are<span class='line-break'> </span>obvious reasons <del>for</del> why an early [period?] should<span class='line-break'> </span>be chosen for carrying it into effect. -</p>

<p>It is probable that the land, on the right of<span class='line-break'> </span>passage, between Mount Auburn &amp; Fresh pond<span class='line-break'> </span>could now be obtained from its present proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>upon more favorable terms, thus it may be<span class='line-break'> </span>hereafter. Moreover the excavations and new<span class='line-break'> </span>deposits of earth which it will be necessary to<span class='line-break'> </span>make, will at the present time interfere less<span class='line-break'> </span>with the rights of private proprietors, then they<span class='line-break'> </span>would do a few years hence, when lots &amp; monuments<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be [?] laid about the water courses.</p>
<p>Lastly - In case the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>should not think it expedient to undertake<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole work at the present time, the<span class='line-break'> </span>committee recommend that measures be taken<span class='line-break'> </span>to ascertain the depth of the [hard?] bottom in<span class='line-break'> </span>Meadow &amp; Garden ponds, and if this is found<span class='line-break'> </span>not to be below the level of tide water, that a<span class='line-break'> </span>suitable trench or channel be dug from Charles<span class='line-break'> </span>river marsh into, or through, Meadow &amp; Garden<span class='line-break'> </span>ponds, to test the practibility of draining these<span class='line-break'> </span>parts of Mount Auburn &amp; redeeming them from their<span class='line-break'> </span>present useless state -</p>
