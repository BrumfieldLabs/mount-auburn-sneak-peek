<p>The Committee to whom was referred the subject <span class='line-break'> </span>of a committee on the subject of introduing <span class='line-break'> </span>fresh water into the grounds at Mount Auburn <span class='line-break'> </span>with directions to take into consideration <span class='line-break'> </span>the various improvements which it may <span class='line-break'> </span>be deemed expedient to make [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>have had the same under their consideration <span class='line-break'> </span>respectfully report.  That by the Act of Incorpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion of the Proprietors of the Cemetery of Mount Au<span class='line-break'></span>burn the monies which shall arise from the Sale of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Lots, &amp; be[?] to the Corporation are required to be <span class='line-break'> </span>devoted &amp; applied to the Preservation, Im<span class='line-break'></span>provement embellishment &amp; enlargement of the said<span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery &amp; the [?] expenss thereof - That <span class='line-break'> </span>hitherto these purposes have been faithfully adhered<span class='line-break'> </span>to - the grounds have been laid out &amp; paths &amp; avenues <span class='line-break'> </span>hav been established, a house with [servicable?] ap<span class='line-break'></span>pendages <del>erected</del>,<sup>built</sup>, a temporary gate way erected,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; a suitable temporary fence enclosing the whole <span class='line-break'> </span>grounds - During the present year a permanent gran<span class='line-break'></span>ite gateway have been substituted for the former wooden<span class='line-break'> </span>one - After [?] all the expenses further to [increas-?]<span class='line-break'> </span>[?], including the expense of the granite Gateway,<span class='line-break'> </span>there will remain at the end of the present year <span class='line-break'> </span>on the Treasusry, according to a [?] made to <span class='line-break'> </span>the Committee<sup>by the Treasurer</sup>the sum of <sup>about</sup> Twenty six thousand dollars<span class='line-break'> </span>applicable to the general <sup>objects</sup>[?]<span class='line-break'> </span>by the Act of Incorporation -</p>
<p>It is well known that among these Objects <span class='line-break'> </span>there are some, which have always from the begin<span class='line-break'></span>ning of the Cemetery been deemed of promis<span class='line-break'></span>ing importance &amp; to which the funds of the Cor<span class='line-break'></span>poration were designed to be applicable as soon as any <span class='line-break'> </span>[?] surplus [?] exist.

<p>encouragement of the Enterprize; &amp; without them little or <span class='line-break'> </span>no success could have been hoped for The Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>therefore deem it their sacred Duty to recommend that <span class='line-break'> </span>these objects should be put <sup>in</sup>a [train?]<span class='line-break'> </span>to ensure their entire accomplishment as early as the funds of the Corpo<span class='line-break'></span>ation shall enable the Trustees to do so --<span class='line-break'> </span>the Committee beg leave to state that the <span class='line-break'> </span>objects to which they have allowed,  are (1) the erection <span class='line-break'> </span>of a permanent stone or Iron fence upon the grounds <sup>of the cemetery[?] fence on the remaining three sides thereof </sup>for  protection &amp; security. (2) The<span class='line-break'> </span>draining of the low grounds, &amp; the introduction of pure <span class='line-break'> </span>water <sup>which should [?]</sup>into the grounds &amp; among the ponds within <span class='line-break'> </span>the same, into Charles River. (3) the Erection of a suitable <span class='line-break'> </span>Granite Chapel where the religious  services for the Dead<span class='line-break'> </span>may be suitably performed, &amp; which also on the in<span class='line-break'> </span>terior sides may become the repository of Marble Busts<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; Statues &amp; other [?] &amp; monuments which may <sup>from time to time</sup>be<span class='line-break'> </span>placed there <sup>by liberal Benefactors &amp; Friends </sup>in memory of the Dead, &amp; which would not <span class='line-break'> </span>bear the exposure of the open air in our climate. (4)<span class='line-break'> </span>The erection of a Granite Tower or Observatory on the <span class='line-break'> </span>summit of Mount Auburn from which<sup>the entire grounds of the Cemetery </sup> and from which the whole range<span class='line-break'> </span>of the adjacent country may be <sup>dis[?]</sup>[?].  These objects <span class='line-break'> </span>in the opinion of the Committee may all be attained<span class='line-break'> </span>within a few years by devoting the present funds of the <span class='line-break'> </span>corporation to them &amp; such additional funds as from <span class='line-break'> </span>past experiences the Committee are justified in believing <span class='line-break'> </span>will unquestionably come into the Treasury within the <span class='line-break'> </span>same period of years - Which of these objects should have <span class='line-break'> </span>a prority, or whether all of them should be simultan<span class='line-break'> </span>eously be undertaken, &amp; a proportion of the present funds <span class='line-break'> </span>applied pro rata to each is a matter for the ultimate <span class='line-break'> </span>decisions of the Trustees.  And it is not improbable <span class='line-break'> </span>that for some of these objects private subscriptions may <span class='line-break'> </span>be obtained from munificant Individuals in aid of <span class='line-break'> </span>such funds as the Trustees may devote to the purpose.</p>
<p>The Committee ask leave to suggest some considerations</p>

<p>for the deliberation of the Trustees which have occurred <span class='line-break'> </span>to them, &amp; which may confirm some of the statements <span class='line-break'> </span>already suggested -<span class='line-break'> </span>(1) As to a permanent fence.  It is belived by the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee that a permanent Iron fence with a <span class='line-break'> </span>suitable granite foundation can be erected of <span class='line-break'> </span>a suitable height <sup>on</sup> the whole length of the Ceme<span class='line-break'></span>tery fronting on the Cambridge &amp; Watertown public <span class='line-break'> </span>Highway for an expense not exceeding 17,000 $$<span class='line-break'> </span>Thousand Dollars - the other three sides of the Ceme<span class='line-break'></span>tery the Committee propose should be enclosed by <span class='line-break'> </span>a hedge fence of Buck Thorn or <sup>some</sup>other Shrub thickly <span class='line-break'> </span>planted [?]<sup>&amp; near to</sup> the present wooden fence.  This <span class='line-break'> </span>should in a few years with suitable care consti<span class='line-break'></span>tute a substantial &amp; beautiful enclosure, might <span class='line-break'> </span>be done at an expense not exceeding 1050$$.</p>
<p>(2) As to draining the Grounds &amp; obtaining a supply of <span class='line-break'> </span>pure water - the various ponds may be made to <span class='line-break'> </span>communcate into each other &amp; the stagnant water <span class='line-break'> </span>be drawn off the same by suitable [?] so as <span class='line-break'> </span>alternately to pass through the low grounds into <span class='line-break'> </span>Charles river -   The Ponds can then be excavated,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; the materials obtained therefrom applied to fertilize<span class='line-break'> </span>the grounds on the borders[?]of the Cemetery  &amp; good gravel<span class='line-break'> </span>bottoms be substituted in the ponds, or if <sup>deemed</sup> necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>or expedient, the ponds can be partially filled up on <span class='line-break'> </span>narrowed in their area.  The Committee estimate<span class='line-break'> </span>the epsense of accomplishing this part of the plans as not <span class='line-break'> </span>exceeding 3000$.</p>
<p>In respect to the conveying of pure water into the grounds,the Committee are aware of more difficulty.  The most prob<span class='line-break'></span>able source of supply is from Fresh Pond by means of <span class='line-break'> </span>an apparatus to raise the water above the level of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Ponds in the Cemetery,<sup>&amp; then to conduct it through the </sup>[?] <span class='line-break'> </span>interior [?] lands [?] the Cemetery <sup>&amp; thence into ther Charles River</sup>.  To accoplish this <span class='line-break'> </span>object some legislative action will probably [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>as well as athe consent of the proprietors, through whose <span class='line-break'> </span>lands the water needs to pass .  A survey of the ponds &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>of these lands has been <sup>already</sup>made, if on estimates of the  <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>probable expense wil be found in the Report of the former <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee which has been recommitted to this Committee <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; to which reference is to be had for a more full un<span class='line-break'></span>derstanding of the project &amp; other [?] matters.</p>
<p>(3) The Erection of a Chapel.  The Committee deem this <span class='line-break'> </span>a very desirable object.  The<span class='line-break'> </span>Chapel ought in their opinion to be built in <span class='line-break'> </span>a chaste style <sup>&amp; taste</sup>of the most durable materials,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; upon a plan which will [?] of great additions <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; enlargements at a future period,without injury <span class='line-break'> </span>to the symmetry &amp; proportions of the original Building,<span class='line-break'> </span>when the religious services &amp; the erection of Monu<span class='line-break'> </span>ments therein shall require such<sup>additions &amp;</sup> enlargements.<span class='line-break'> </span>If the Chapel should be now erected of a suitable <span class='line-break'> </span>heighth, of Ashlar<sup>Granite</sup> it may be lighted by <span class='line-break'> </span>a dome or Lantern <sup>or skylight </sup>in the Top, &amp; the four sides be <span class='line-break'> </span>reserved for Busts &amp; Statues or Monuments.  The accom<span class='line-break'></span>modations for the religious services may be by<span class='line-break'> </span>a moveable pulpit &amp; movable seats, to be placed <span class='line-break'> </span>in such positions as the occasion may require.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Chapel<sup>when</sup>built, may if it is thought best,<span class='line-break'> </span>constitute the Nave or part of the Nave of [?] thereof<span class='line-break'> </span>which shall become with its future Transepts a Latin <span class='line-break'> </span>or Greek Cross - As has been already suggested, private <span class='line-break'> </span>subscriptions may for [?] be obtained to aid in <span class='line-break'> </span>the accomplishment of this object.  Probably the whole <span class='line-break'> </span>expense of such a chapel for the present purposes<sup>of the cemetery</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>would not exceed 5000$</p>
<p>(4).  The Erection of a Tower or Observatory.  It is be<span class='line-break'></span>lieved by the Committee that this may be accomplished<span class='line-break'> </span>at a very moderate expense<sup>&amp; yet be [?]</sup> of the sort of permanent <span class='line-break'> </span>materials, ^<sup>it</sup>will be ast once a great convenience &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>Ornament to the grounds.  A round Tower of <span class='line-break'> </span>granite Ashlar<sup>Granite</sup> may be built sixty feet high <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; of a proper diameter suitable for an easy<span class='line-break'> </span>ascent &amp; descent at an expense not exceeding -7000$</p>
<p>The Committee are<sup>also</sup>of the opinion, that it is <span class='line-break'> </span>wholey unnessary to reserve out of the present funds <span class='line-break'> </span>in the corporation a sum exceeding 3000$ <span class='line-break'> </span>to meet any [?] expenditures of the Cemetery.</p>

<p>before new funds will accrue; &amp; it is but a just<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] with the known Intentions of the Proprietors <span class='line-break'> </span>to appropriate the revenue to one or more or all of <span class='line-break'> </span>the objects Already indicated.</p>

<p>All of which is respectuflly submitted by the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee   Joseph Story  Chairman</p>
<p>A.  The committee beg leave to add that in making <span class='line-break'> </span>the appropriation of the funds of the Corporation for <span class='line-break'> </span>the purposes aforesaid, they have not lost sight of their <span class='line-break'> </span>duty to reserve out of the funds <sup>which may arise from</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>the sales of the Lots a sum sufficient to ensure in <span class='line-break'> </span>perpetuity the due Improvements &amp; Preservation <sup>&amp; ornament</sup>of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery &amp; the payment of the [?] expenses there <span class='line-break'> </span>of.  They are aware that the <sup>number of</sup> Lots<span class='line-break'> </span>which will remain on hand will be every year di<span class='line-break'></span>minishing &amp; therefore that it will be necessary to make <span class='line-break'> </span>suitable provisions to meet the Time, when they can <span class='line-break'> </span>no longer expect to realize any new funds.  That <span class='line-break'> </span>time, however must be distant; &amp; the Lots now on hand <span class='line-break'> </span>are more than sufficient to meet all the future expen<span class='line-break'> </span>ditures which may be required for any of athe purposes <span class='line-break'> </span>to which they ghave refered.</p>
