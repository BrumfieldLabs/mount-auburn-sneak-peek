<p>The undersigned appointed a Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>to examine the Garden and <a href='/pages/subjects/57864' title='Halcyon Lake'>Garden Pond</a> at<span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn, and to report what improve<span class='line-break'></span>ments can be made therein, in order to render<span class='line-break'> </span>the Garden productive and profitable - and<span class='line-break'> </span>also whether the sluice running under <a href='/pages/subjects/54338' title='Indian Ridge Path'>Indian<span class='line-break'> </span>Ridge</a> shall be cleared out, have attended to<span class='line-break'> </span>the duty assigned them and beg leave to<span class='line-break'> </span>submit the following _ Report.</p>
<p>The attention of your committee was first<span class='line-break'> </span>occupied with the actual state of the Garden,<span class='line-break'> </span>as originally laid out into plots. - and to the<span class='line-break'> </span>character of the soil. _this, they find to be light,<span class='line-break'> </span>restly partly upon gravel, and partly upon a<span class='line-break'> </span>sandy subsoil, but growing deeper as you approach<span class='line-break'> </span>the public road. a considerable quantity of the<span class='line-break'> </span>clearings of the ponds have been added to it.<span class='line-break'> </span>and much of it is now, and nearly all of it<span class='line-break'> </span>may be made, suitable for the cultivation of<span class='line-break'> </span>trees, flowering shrubs, and the usual purposes</p>

<p>of a garden. _ Several of the compartments have been<span class='line-break'> </span>used for the growth of annual flowering plants, <span class='line-break'> </span>serving to ornament the grounds when in bloom,<span class='line-break'> </span>but of no other value, and, of course, requiring<span class='line-break'> </span>an annual planting. _ It is recommended<span class='line-break'> </span>that some of these plats be filled with cuttings<span class='line-break'> </span>of Foreign and Native Grape Vines. - prunings<span class='line-break'> </span>of the proper varieties, sufficient for from 5. to 10,000<span class='line-break'> </span>cuttings might at once be collected, and<span class='line-break'> </span>prepared for planting in the Spring as soon as the<span class='line-break'> </span>season will permit. _ In from two to three years<span class='line-break'> </span>these plants will be large enough for removal,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the present marketable value of such is<span class='line-break'> </span>in considerable quantities 25 cents each._</p>
<p>Other of the plats might be filled with cuttings<span class='line-break'> </span>of Scotch Goosberries, and the large growing<span class='line-break'> </span>kinds of Red and White Dutch Currants. _<span class='line-break'> </span>the outlay and the expence of culture for these,<span class='line-break'> </span>the plats being already prepared for their reception,<span class='line-break'> </span>would be comparatively trifling, and the certainty<span class='line-break'> </span>of the identity of the sorts, grown in the garden</p>

<p>Your Committee have made an examination<span class='line-break'> </span>of all the grounds, with a view of ascertaining<span class='line-break'> </span>where the best land is located, and they have<span class='line-break'> </span>discovered a piece situated south of "<a href='/pages/subjects/57595' title='Gerry Lane'>Gerry Lane</a>",<span class='line-break'> </span>comprising about an acre and a half, which appears<span class='line-break'> </span>to be as good as any there is, and which the<span class='line-break'> </span>gardner thinks is the best._This, it is recommended<span class='line-break'> </span>to have turned up with the plough, either this autumn,<span class='line-break'> </span>or in the spring, and reduced to good tilth by culti<span class='line-break'></span>vating upon it a crop of vegetables, preparatory<span class='line-break'> </span>to making</p>
