<p>grounds - During the present Year a permanent granite<span class='line-break'> </span>gateway has been substituted for the frame wooden one.</p>
<p>After dedicating all the expense <del>of the granite</del> hitherto<span class='line-break'> </span>incurred, including the expense of the granite gateway<span class='line-break'> </span>there will remain at the end of the present year in<span class='line-break'> </span>the Treasury, according to a statement made to the<span class='line-break'> </span>committee by the treasurer, the sum of about Twenty six<span class='line-break'> </span>thousand Dillars applicable to the general objects<span class='line-break'> </span>Contemplated by the Act of Incorporation;</p>
<p>It is well known that among<span class='line-break'> </span>these objects there are some, which <del>have been</del> always from the<span class='line-break'> </span>beginning of the Cemetary been deemed of primary impor<span class='line-break'></span>tance, to which the funds of Corporation were designed<span class='line-break'> </span>to be applied - as soon any adaquate surplus should<span class='line-break'> </span>exist, Indeed these objects were held out to the original<span class='line-break'> </span>Subscribers as the main inducement for their patron<span class='line-break'> </span>-age &amp; encouragement of the enterprise; &amp; without them<span class='line-break'> </span>little or no success could have been hoped for -</p>
<p>The Committee therefore deemed it their severed duty<span class='line-break'> </span>to recommend that these objects should be put<span class='line-break'> </span>in a train to ensure their entire accomplishment<span class='line-break'> </span>as early as the funds' of the corporation shall enable<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees to do so. The Committee beg leave to state<span class='line-break'> </span>that the objects - to which they have alluded are</p>

<p>The erection of a permanent Stone or Iron fence<span class='line-break'> </span>upon the front grounds' of the Cemetary &amp; a hedge or<span class='line-break'> </span>fence on the remaining three sides thereof for these</p>

<p>In respect to the conveying of the pure water -<span class='line-break'> </span>into the grounds, the Committee are aware of some<span class='line-break'> </span>difficulty - The most probably Source of Supply is from<span class='line-break'> </span>Fresh pond by means of an apparatus to raise the<span class='line-break'> </span>water above the level of the ponds in the Cemetery &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>then to conduct^it^ through the intermediate lands<span class='line-break'> </span>ito the Cemetery &amp; thence to Charles River.
