<p>The undersigned to whom was referred the <span class='line-break'> </span>communication of Mr W. F. Shaw relative to the planting <span class='line-break'> </span>of cherry and other trees likely to attract birds to the <span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery report:</p>
<p>The Trustees are not empowered to plant trees<span class='line-break'> </span>in private lots.  Proprietors have the<del>exclusive</del><sup>a limited</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>right to plant thereon such shrubbery as they <span class='line-break'> </span>may elect.  It does not appear to be expedient <span class='line-break'> </span>to so far anticipate the tastes of future proprietors <span class='line-break'> </span>of the lots now on sale <del>by</del><sup>as to</sup>plan within them orna<span class='line-break'></span>mental shrubbery which may not conform to the<span class='line-break'> </span>views of their purchasers, and which they would <span class='line-break'> </span>have the right to remove.  The opportunities there<span class='line-break'> </span>fore for the Trustees to meet the wishes of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Shaw is quite limited, and not sufficient <span class='line-break'> </span>to accomplish any results.</p>
<p>There are moreover reasons that [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>some [restriction?] as to commending a general <span class='line-break'> </span>planting of the cherry, even within these restricted <span class='line-break'> </span>limits.  It is not well adapted for growth <span class='line-break'> </span>in close proximity to other trees.  In such po<span class='line-break'></span>sitions it is wont to be not ornamental <span class='line-break'> </span>and unproductive.  And, even under the most<span class='line-break'> </span>favorable circumstances it is generally not an orna<span class='line-break'></span>mental tree, while the dropping of its fruit at cer<span class='line-break'></span>tain seasons, is frequently a source of disfigure<span class='line-break'></span></p>

<p>ment to the grounds to its shades.  Nor are there many<span class='line-break'> </span>varieties of birds attracted by its fruit.  If the <span class='line-break'> </span>three hundred species that visit Massachusetts, <span class='line-break'> </span>we might almost count on the fingers of a sin<span class='line-break'></span>gle hand the kind that feed on the fruit of <span class='line-break'> </span>the cultivated cherry.  There are other trees <span class='line-break'> </span>and many shrubs more [available?] for this <span class='line-break'> </span>purpose.  The red-cedar the Sae[?], the <span class='line-break'> </span>cornets[?] and above all others, the mountain <span class='line-break'> </span>ash have their larger number of admirers.<span class='line-break'> </span>This matter of the selection of certain <span class='line-break'> </span>varieties of fruit-bearing shrubbery is a<span class='line-break'> </span>subject worthy of our attention. A list <span class='line-break'> </span>of such suitable fruit-bearing shrubbs as we <span class='line-break'> </span>can recommend for planting in the ceme<span class='line-break'></span>tery would be a valuable acquisition and is <span class='line-break'> </span>a matter well worthy the consideration of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Commmittee on grounds.  Its preparation, how<span class='line-break'></span>ever, can only be completed with time and the <span class='line-break'> </span>experience of several years.  To this sub<span class='line-break'></span>ject we recommend the attention of our <span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent in the hope and belief that <span class='line-break'> </span>a careful study of the respective active in <span class='line-break'> </span>this connection, of different varieties of <span class='line-break'> </span>trees and shrubs would lend to valuable <span class='line-break'> </span>knowledge and be made the means of cor-</p>
