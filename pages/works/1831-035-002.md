<p>The Committee on the subject of Birds in the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery of Mt Auburn report, at the close of <span class='line-break'> </span>the present year a small improvement though <span class='line-break'> </span>not such as was anticipated at the commencement .<span class='line-break'> </span>The endeavor to introduce singing birds from Eu<span class='line-break'></span>rope into our grounds has thus far been un<span class='line-break'></span>successful in consequence of the failure of <span class='line-break'> </span>the party contracted with to supply the birds<span class='line-break'> </span>to fulfil his agreement.  Acting upon the ad<span class='line-break'></span>vice of experienced bird fanciers your com<span class='line-break'></span>mittee decided to experiment with one of the<span class='line-break'> </span>best known of the song birds of Europe - the Black<span class='line-break'> </span>cap Warbler - Next to the Nightingale this bird <span class='line-break'> </span>is esteemed the best singer of Europe.  It is <span class='line-break'> </span>a more hardy bird is much more abundant,<span class='line-break'> </span>is easily trapped and less expensive to pro<span class='line-break'></span>cure.  It is also easily reconciled to confinement <span class='line-break'> </span>and can be easily and cheaply fed during <span class='line-break'> </span>the winter months.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>Your committee contracted with one of the <span class='line-break'> </span>large German ghouses in New York, engaged in <span class='line-break'> </span>the importation of birds, to deliver twenty four <span class='line-break'> </span>of this species at Mt Auburn about the close of <span class='line-break'> </span>October.  A room was fitted for their reception <span class='line-break'> </span>in one of the new green-houses and every possi<span class='line-break'></span>ble provision made for their warmth and care.<span class='line-break'> </span>It was proposed to keep them in these warm<span class='line-break'> </span>and comfortable quarters until the spring <span class='line-break'> </span>season was so far advanced that they would <span class='line-break'> </span>with safety  be released, in the expectation <span class='line-break'> </span>that they would mate in the grounds of Mt<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn, and, following the laws of the [?]  of <span class='line-break'> </span>Birds, would return in the following season to <span class='line-break'> </span>the spot of their origin.  The importer ex<span class='line-break'></span>cuses his non fulfilment of his agreement on <span class='line-break'> </span>the ground that the season in Europe was <span class='line-break'> </span>cold and fatal to the young birds and that <span class='line-break'> </span>they could not be procured.</p>
<p>In the water fowl we have been a little more <span class='line-break'> </span>successful.  We have added to the group of <span class='line-break'> </span>ducks a pair of pure hite Muscovies.</p>

<p>and within a few weeks we have been so fortu<span class='line-break'></span>nate as to secure three young birds of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Trumpeter Swan.  This is an American Swan <span class='line-break'> </span>the largest know swan in the world, and<span class='line-break'> </span>its domestication is comparatively[?] a new <span class='line-break'> </span>affair.  They were taken from the west the <span class='line-break'> </span>past summer in Northwestern Iowa <span class='line-break'> </span>where just from the shell, are perfectly tame <span class='line-break'> </span>and promise to be a great acc[?] to our <span class='line-break'> </span>grounds.  Their brilliant white plumage,<span class='line-break'> </span>contrasted  with their jet-black feet &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>their large size will render them a con<span class='line-break'></span>spicuous ornamaent to our grounds.</p>
