<p>Jan 7<sup>th</sup> 1873</p>
<p>The committee in charge of the Birds <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mt Auburn have to report that the <span class='line-break'> </span>water fowl belonging to the Cemetery have <span class='line-break'> </span>generally thrived during the season.  With the <span class='line-break'> </span>exception of the death of one of the <span class='line-break'> </span>oldest pair of European Swans, we have <span class='line-break'> </span>no casualty to report - The pair of Trumpe<span class='line-break'> </span>ter swans, purchased from [?] a year <span class='line-break'> </span>since have grown both in size and in <span class='line-break'> </span>beauty and are now large and handsome.<span class='line-break'> </span>the large variety of jet black ducks pur<span class='line-break'></span>chased of Mr Austin prove quite an ac<span class='line-break'></span>quisition to the grounds and have quintu<span class='line-break'></span>pled in numbers.  We have now on hand<span class='line-break'> </span>five Swans, two white Muscovy ducks, <span class='line-break'> </span>fifty one small white ducks, and fourteen <span class='line-break'> </span>of the black variety, in all seventy=-two<span class='line-break'> </span>water fowl.</p>
<p>Our committee regret to have to add <span class='line-break'> </span>to this report, that we fear the attempt</p>

After <span class='line-break'> </span>a few weeks of apparent good health,<span class='line-break'> </span>after their long sea voyage, and <span class='line-break'> </span>when to all appearances they were <span class='line-break'> </span>in a thriving condition, suddenly and <span class='line-break'> </span>without any assignable cause, an <span class='line-break'> </span>epidemic seemed to break out, in <span class='line-break'> </span>the season of their first moult which <span class='line-break'> </span>has taken off about two thirds of <span class='line-break'> </span>our flock of thirty.  It now seems very <span class='line-break'> </span>doubtful whether enough will be [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>next May, to give much grounds for <span class='line-break'> </span>hoping they will prove enough to <span class='line-break'> </span>found a reproducing colony.</p>
