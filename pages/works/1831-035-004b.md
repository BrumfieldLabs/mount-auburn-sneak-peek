<p>Israel M. Spelman Esq.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I regret that my<span class='line-break'> </span>arrangement, made to enable me to attend<span class='line-break'> </span>the meeting of this afternoon - will prevent<span class='line-break'> </span>me from being at (?) of Friday.</p>
<p>I enclose the letter of Mr. Holden on the<span class='line-break'> </span>matter of the Swans. It is most unsatis<span class='line-break'></span>factory but I am not surprised. The<span class='line-break'> </span>same parties had asked $125. for an<span class='line-break'> </span>odd swan when we tried to find a mate<span class='line-break'> </span>now offer less than a twelfth part for<span class='line-break'> </span>the purchase.</p>
<p>My own opinion is our uneasiness as <span class='line-break'> </span>to any real danger to be apprehended<span class='line-break'> </span>from any of these birds is (?).</p>
<p>I am unable to learn of any instance,<span class='line-break'> </span>in which any individual of this class<span class='line-break'> </span>of bird (?) ever inflicted injury.</p>
<p>The case of Mrs. Greer (?) was quite<span class='line-break'> </span>exceptional. Since the meeting I (?)<span class='line-break'> </span>again seen Ex Gov. Gardner and he<span class='line-break'> </span>re-affirmed the statement that Mrs. G<span class='line-break'> </span>poiked at the swan which was</p>

<p>To relieve ourselves of these once<span class='line-break'> </span>(?) to our grounds, in my judgment<span class='line-break'> </span>would be unwise and unnecessary. To<span class='line-break'> </span>assure safety the two culprits could<span class='line-break'> </span>be safely enclosedout of reach of the <span class='line-break'> </span>(?) by means of a leather (?)<span class='line-break'> </span>one leg, so loose as not to bind, so tight<span class='line-break'> </span>as not to (?)
