<p>Boston August 23<sup>d</sup> 1870</p>
<p>To the Trustees of Mount Auburn Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Respectfully represents the undersigned, owner of<span class='line-break'> </span>Lot 1605 on Cypress Avenue; desirous of having Steps<span class='line-break'> </span>placed at the entrance of said Lot ordered them<span class='line-break'> </span>to made of wood to be painted &amp; finished to imi<span class='line-break'></span>tate granite, believing that I had a perfect right<span class='line-break'> </span>to do so. They were made agreeably to order, painted<span class='line-break'> </span>two coats, sent to the Cemetery to be put down &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>to be grained after they were set.</p>
<p>The workmen were forbidden, by the Superintendent,<span class='line-break'> </span>to proceed without obtaining permission from the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees or their representatives.</p>
<p>As I deem it of importance to have the question permanent<span class='line-break'></span>ly settled, I Respectfully ask your [decision?] whether<span class='line-break'> </span>Steps made of Wood shall be permitted to be placed<span class='line-break'> </span>at the entrance of any Lot in the Cemetery.</p>
<p>In Article 26, published in 1860, I find Wooden Fences<span class='line-break'> </span>prohibited, but Wooden Steps nowhere.</p>
<p>Wood <sup>is</sup> used for steps of respectable dwellings and<span class='line-break'> </span>have stood firm for years 'tho in frequent use;<span class='line-break'> </span>Would they not remain undecayed longer in a<span class='line-break'> </span>Grave Yard? If suffered to be neglected, by the owner<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Lot, the Superintendent has ample power to<span class='line-break'> </span>remove them as a nuisance. I disclaim any intention<span class='line-break'> </span>of violating <sup>the</sup> Rules &amp; Regulations of <sup>the</sup> Cemetery or of complaining<span class='line-break'> </span>of the course taken by the Superintendent, believing that<span class='line-break'> </span>he has acted from a sense of duty &amp; full determination<span class='line-break'> </span>to do equal justic to the parties interested.</p>
<p>By examining the Steps alluded to, I trust that you will find,<span class='line-break'> </span>if we are permitted to have them put down, they will not<span class='line-break'> </span>disfigure the grounds or be objected to <sup>by</sup> owners of the Lots.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, by [C?] Mitchell<span class='line-break'> </span>No 139 Conard Street.</p>
