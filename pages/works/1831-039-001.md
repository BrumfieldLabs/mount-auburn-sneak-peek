<p>Dr Bigelow as a committee appointed<span class='line-break'> </span>to repair the Statue of Dr. Bowditch<span class='line-break'> </span>reports - That he has examined the said <span class='line-break'> </span>statue with the assistance of competent mechanics,<span class='line-break'> </span>that he finds the whole in a bad &amp; almost worthless<span class='line-break'> </span>state, being apparently made of base metal, &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>full of holes which were concealed by cement in <span class='line-break'> </span>the original casting, but are now open, not <span class='line-break'> </span>only disfiguring the statue but admitting the rain,<span class='line-break'> </span>which by freezing in winter has caused several <span class='line-break'> </span>cracks from 6 to 9 inches in length.  That this <span class='line-break'> </span>statue is now in process of destruction and is not <span class='line-break'> </span>worth any<sup>more</sup>expensive repair, than a coat of <span class='line-break'> </span>putty &amp; paint which may keep it together for <span class='line-break'> </span>a number of years longer.</p>
<p>The Committee regrets that that this <span class='line-break'> </span>statue had not been rejected at the beginning <span class='line-break'> </span>agreeably to a recommendation of a committee <span class='line-break'> </span>of the <del>pro</del>subscribers to which he had the honor <span class='line-break'> </span>to act as chairman</p>
<p>Jacob Bigelow, committee<span class='line-break'> </span>July 5. 1853</p>
<p>Voted that the Gate keeper be instructed <span class='line-break'> </span>to admit <sup>persons of respectable appearance and demeanor</sup><del>strangers from a distance to </del>ride into <span class='line-break'> </span>the cemetery without <sup>tickets or</sup>permits until further order.</p>
