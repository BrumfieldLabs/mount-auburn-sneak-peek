<p>At a meeting of the Trustees of Mt. Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery, holden <date when='1854-09-04'>Sept. 4, 1854</date>, it was</p>
<p><ins>Voted</ins>. That the sum of fifteen thousand<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars be appropriated for the purchase of three marble<span class='line-break'> </span>statues, to be prepared and executed under contracts to be<span class='line-break'> </span>made with proper artists, said statues to be those of<span class='line-break'> </span>persons distinguished in American History. But<span class='line-break'> </span>this vote is subject to the following conditions, viz,<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>first</ins> - that it shall be approved in writing by five<span class='line-break'> </span>at least of this board of trustees ; and <ins>second</ins> that<span class='line-break'> </span>the professional opinions of <a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>C.P. Curtis</a> Esq. and the<span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary on the subject of the legality of this appropria<span class='line-break'></span>tion by this board shall be taken in writing and<span class='line-break'> </span>found to sustain the legality of such appropriation.</p>
<p>Attest. <a href='/pages/subjects/62332' title='Parker, Henry Melville'>Henry M. Parker</a><span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary</p>
<p>-- Opinion --</p>
<p>The subject thus submitted to us involves two<span class='line-break'> </span>distinct questions ; <ins>first</ins>, whether the appropriation<span class='line-break'> </span>be in itself legal, and <ins>second</ins>, whether if legal th<ins>e</ins><span class='line-break'> </span><ins>Trustees</ins> are authorized to make the appropriation.</p>
<p>There seems to be no room for doubt as to<span class='line-break'> </span>the second question. By Section 4<sup>th</sup> of the Charter<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Corporation it is provided that the said<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees shall have the general management,</p>

If the Corporation's funds<span class='line-break'> </span>can be properly applied to the purchase of Statuary, -<span class='line-break'> </span>these words are large enough to show that the Board<span class='line-break'> </span>of Trustees is the proper body to make the appropria<span class='line-break'></span>tion and contract for the statues. <ins>Can</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>funds</ins><span class='line-break'> </span><ins>be properly so applied?</ins></p>
<p>The present Corporation took the conveyance of<span class='line-break'> </span>the "Garden and Cemetery" not as an ordinary purchase<span class='line-break'> </span>of land by a Corporation for the purpose of establishing<span class='line-break'> </span>a Cemetery but upon sundry special trusts which<span class='line-break'> </span>limit and restrain the full liberty of the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>in the use of the property and its proceeds. These<span class='line-break'> </span>trusts are set forth in the tenth section of the Charter,<span class='line-break'> </span>and to that section our remarks will be principally<span class='line-break'> </span>confined ; but some additional light may be deri<span class='line-break'></span>ved in the interpretation of it from a part of <span class='line-break'> </span>sections two and six. From these it appears that<span class='line-break'> </span>the "Proprietors" hold the land (s 2) " upon the same<span class='line-break'> </span>trusts and for the same purposes as the said Massa<span class='line-break'></span>chusetts <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'>Horticultural society</a> held the same" by<span class='line-break'> </span>virtue of the statute of 1831.

<p>said act were to be "<ins>transferred to and exercised by</ins>"<span class='line-break'> </span>the new Corporation. These provisions are important,<span class='line-break'> </span>because the <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'>Mass. Hort. Society</a> might be called<span class='line-break'> </span>upon to enforce the execution of the trusts under <span class='line-break'> </span>the tenth section, and if there should seem to be<span class='line-break'> </span>any doubt as to the construction of the language the<span class='line-break'> </span>actual interpretation, formerly given by that <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'><!--Mass Hort-->Society</a><span class='line-break'> </span>to its own charter, would, if similar to the meas<span class='line-break'></span>ure now proposed, serve in some degree as an<span class='line-break'> </span>answer to any present objection from that quarter.<span class='line-break'> </span>And even if no interpretation had been given<span class='line-break'> </span>by the <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'><!--Mass Hort-->Society</a> itself, or its officers, to the Act of<span class='line-break'> </span>1831, still the very language of that act may<span class='line-break'> </span>serve to enlarge or diminish the meaning of<span class='line-break'> </span>the present Company's charter.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Corporation derives<span class='line-break'> </span>no power to appropriate monies from the proceeds<span class='line-break'> </span>of sales of lots in the original cemetery to the<span class='line-break'> </span>purchase of statuary, from the ninth section.<span class='line-break'> </span>Under that section they may undoubtedly take<span class='line-break'> </span>statuary, or money for the purchase of statuary,<span class='line-break'> </span>by bequest or donation, and contract for its preser<span class='line-break'></span>vation in the Cemetery. But the words of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Act in that section are much larger than those<span class='line-break'> </span>in the tenth, and can only have a remote bearing<span class='line-break'> </span>upon the construction of the latter, as shewing [sic], what<span class='line-break'> </span>kind of "embellishments" the legislature consid<span class='line-break'></span>ered as appropriate to the Cemetery.</p>

<p>Coming then to the tenth section we find<span class='line-break'> </span>that it provides, that the portion of the proceeds<span class='line-break'> </span>of sales to be retained by the Proprietors of the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>"shall be forever devoted and applied to the pres<span class='line-break'></span>ervation, improvement, embellishment and en<span class='line-break'></span>largement of the said Cemetery and Garden,<span class='line-break'> </span>"and the incidental expenses thereof <ins>and</ins> <ins>to no</ins><span class='line-break'> </span><ins>other</ins> <ins>purpose</ins> <ins>whatsoever</ins>."  These last words<span class='line-break'> </span>are strong words of restraint upon the Corporation,<span class='line-break'> </span>and should lead the Trustees to to see that every<span class='line-break'> </span>appropriation made by them comes strictly under<span class='line-break'> </span>one or another of the heads thus mentioned. And<span class='line-break'> </span>it is clear that the appropriation for the purchase of<span class='line-break'> </span>statuary can come fairly and fully under one of<span class='line-break'> </span>these heads only viz, that of the <ins>embellishment<del>s</del></ins> <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Cemetery.</p>
<p>We understand that it is not enough to<span class='line-break'> </span>bring an appropriation under this head, that it<span class='line-break'> </span>should be for the purpose of making the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>a more attractive resort ; of a collection of mere<span class='line-break'> </span>curiosities, or relics of ancient times, however much<span class='line-break'> </span>they might "embellish" the place, in one sense<span class='line-break'> </span>would not, in our judgment, be such "embellish<span class='line-break'></span>ments" of the Cemetery as this Section of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Act contemplates. Neither would the establish<span class='line-break'></span>ment of an historical library, though that is in<span class='line-break'> </span>some sense the best monument to the worthy<span class='line-break'> </span>dead.

<p>Reasoning from the analogy of such decisions<span class='line-break'> </span>we might well say, that it by no means follows<span class='line-break'> </span>as a matter of course, that because you have<span class='line-break'> </span>properly spent money for a Chapel in which<span class='line-break'> </span>statues may be becomingly placed you may<span class='line-break'> </span>go on to <ins>provide</ins> statues for the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a>.
