<p>The <del>Committee are</del>^<sup>undersigned is</sup> aware that a diversity<span class='line-break'> </span>of opinion has existed upon the expediency,<span class='line-break'> </span>as well as the right of the Trustees to<span class='line-break'> </span>expend the money of the Corporation for<span class='line-break'> </span>purposes extraneous to, if not directly adverse,<span class='line-break'> </span>to the priveleges conferred upon it by the<span class='line-break'> </span>charter.</p>
<p>By the act of incorporation, the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>were allowed to expend the moneys received<span class='line-break'> </span>from the sale of lots "for the preservation,<span class='line-break'> </span>improvement, embelishment and enlargement<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Cemetery and Garden, and the incidental<span class='line-break'> </span>expenses thereof, and for no other purpose<span class='line-break'> </span>whatsoever."</p>

<p>the obvious and real meaning of these<span class='line-break'> </span>terms and what construction was designed<span class='line-break'> </span>to be placed upon them?</p>
<p>In order that a correct conclusion may<span class='line-break'> </span>be arrived at, it is necessary to revert for<span class='line-break'> </span>a moment to the circumstances under which<span class='line-break'> </span>the act of incorporation was obtained and<span class='line-break'> </span>what was designed by those who originated<span class='line-break'> </span>the project.- It appears to ^<sup>the undersigned</sup><del>your Committee</del><span class='line-break'> </span>that the design was this-the subject of<span class='line-break'> </span>interments within the limits of the city having<span class='line-break'> </span>become one of great importance in our<span class='line-break'> </span>community and an evil which would be<span class='line-break'> </span>likely to increase as the population became<span class='line-break'> </span>more dense, it was very desirable that the<span class='line-break'> </span>system should be changed so far as it<span class='line-break'> </span>was practicable to do so, and some place of<span class='line-break'> </span>interment be secured in the vicinity of the <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>City<!--Boston--></a><span class='line-break'> </span>which should obviate the evil complained<span class='line-break'> </span>of.</p>
<p>For these purposes the grounds now known<span class='line-break'> </span>as "Mount Auburn" were obtained and<span class='line-break'> </span>consecrated.-</p>
<p>An act of incorporation was granted by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Legislature, giving certain priveleges to, and<span class='line-break'> </span>placing certain restrictions upon the Corporation, <sub>one</sub></p>

<p>of which was that the moneys received<span class='line-break'> </span>from the sales of lots should be expended<span class='line-break'> </span>for no other purpose than those stated<span class='line-break'> </span>in this report. -</p>
<p>It is obvious from the terms of the <span class='line-break'> </span>charter, that the right to erect an expensive<span class='line-break'> </span>chapel and furnish it with splendid <span class='line-break'> </span>statuary, or other works of art, if it exists<span class='line-break'> </span>at all, must be derived from the authority<span class='line-break'> </span>to embelish the grounds. -</p>
<p>An opinion has been given by one of the<span class='line-break'> </span>present Committee, (<a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>Mr Curtis</a>), that the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees do possess the legal right, at<span class='line-break'> </span>least so far as to expend fifteen thousand<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars for Statuary; which opinion is on<span class='line-break'> </span>the Records of the Corporation; and as it<span class='line-break'> </span>has been accepted and acted upon by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees, it is not necessary here to discuss<span class='line-break'> </span>the question, no to say how large a field<span class='line-break'> </span>the word "embelishment", appears to ^ <sup>the undersigned</sup> <del>some of</del><span class='line-break'> </span><del>the Committee</del> to cover -</p>
<p>If then it be assumed for the purposes <span class='line-break'> </span>of this discussion that the Trustees have<span class='line-break'> </span>the legal right, the next question is as to<span class='line-break'> </span>the expediency of spending money for such<span class='line-break'> </span>embelishments. -  We<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>that if the amount to be paid for these<span class='line-break'> </span>statues should be placed at interest and<span class='line-break'> </span>the income derived from it be spent upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the grounds, -- in keeping there in more perfect<span class='line-break'> </span>order than has hitherto been the case, that<span class='line-break'> </span>it would be far more for the reputation<span class='line-break'> </span>of the place, and the pleasure and comfort <span class='line-break'> </span>of the visitors and proprietors, than would<span class='line-break'> </span>be the exhibition of the statuary, however<span class='line-break'> </span>beautiful.---</p>
<p>One among the many reasons why this<span class='line-break'> </span>statuary should not be procured, is ,<del>that</del><span class='line-break'> </span>the state of the finances of the Corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>By the last annual report of the Treasurer <span class='line-break'> </span>it appears that the property belonging to <span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation amounted to the sum of<span class='line-break'> </span>$29,900 estimating the stocks in which it<span class='line-break'> </span>was invested at par -- while nearly all of <span class='line-break'> </span>^<sup>them</sup> are greatly depreciated. --- It also appears<span class='line-break'> </span>by the Treasurer's report, that the expenditures<span class='line-break'> </span>exceeded the income, (which included the<span class='line-break'> </span>sales of lots during the year), $252.51 --<span class='line-break'></span>We shall therefore find when all the<span class='line-break'> </span>lots are sold, if we proceed in this<span class='line-break'> </span>manner, that we have the "embellishments" <span class='line-break'> </span>on</p>

<p>hand, but no funds and no means<span class='line-break'> </span>to meet the current expenses of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation. ---</p>
<p>Another reason why the statuary should<span class='line-break'> </span>not be placed in the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a> is, that<span class='line-break'> </span>in the opinion of may persons who<span class='line-break'> </span>profess ^<sup>or are supposed</sup> to be judges in such matters, the<span class='line-break'> </span>light will not be good and the beauties<span class='line-break'> </span>of the statues will not be seen to advantage,<span class='line-break'> </span>nor justice be done to the artists who shall<span class='line-break'> </span>construct them ---</p>
<p>But it is not necessary here to detail <span class='line-break'> </span>all the objections to the plan.---</p>
<p>The <del>Committee</del> ^<sup>undersigned</sup> believes that an arrangement<span class='line-break'> </span>can be entered into with the artists who<span class='line-break'> </span>have been engaged to make the statues,<span class='line-break'> </span>to relinquish the contracts by making them<span class='line-break'> </span>a liberal compensation for the work<span class='line-break'> </span>already done --- but if that cannot be <span class='line-break'> </span>accomplished, -- that some disposition can<span class='line-break'> </span>be made of the statues when completed by<span class='line-break'> </span>which a large part of the expenditure <span class='line-break'> </span>may be returned to the Corporation, and<span class='line-break'> </span>if</p>

<p>only one half of the amount should<span class='line-break'> </span>be saved, that sum at compound<span class='line-break'> </span>interest, in twelve years would give the<span class='line-break'> </span>original sum expended --- whereas if<span class='line-break'> </span>the statues should be placed in the <span class='line-break'> </span>chapel, it is very evident that during <span class='line-break'> </span>the twelve years they would not increase <span class='line-break'> </span>in value. ---</p>
