<p>The Committee appointed "to examine <span class='line-break'> </span>consider &amp; report whether any or all <span class='line-break'> </span>of the contracts for making Statuary for <span class='line-break'> </span>the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a> can be rescinded" have met <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; considered the subject referred to them, <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; and a majority of the Committee report - <span class='line-break'> </span>that although a legal contract can be <span class='line-break'> </span><ins>rescinded</ins> by the consent of <ins>both</ins> the parties <span class='line-break'> </span>to it, one of the parties cannot do so: <span class='line-break'> </span>He may <ins>repudiate</ins> or <ins>break</ins> the contract, <span class='line-break'> </span>subjecting himself of course to reclamation <span class='line-break'> </span>by the other party, but he cannot rescind <span class='line-break'> </span>it. - As the Artists with whom the <span class='line-break'> </span>contracts for Statuary have been made are <span class='line-break'> </span>in Italy, it has not been possible to con<span class='line-break'></span>sult them touching the descission [sic] of their <span class='line-break'> </span>engagements ^with this Corporation; - But as this might be <span class='line-break'> </span>done in a few weeks, the undersigned <span class='line-break'> </span>deem it proper to express the opinion <span class='line-break'> </span>that they do not consider it expedient <span class='line-break'> </span>to take any further ^steps in this matter. -</p>
<p>Whether, if the purchase of Statuary <span class='line-break'> </span>for the Cemetery were now an open ques<span class='line-break'></span>tion, it were expedient to <del> do so </del> make such purchase as a very <span class='line-break'> </span>different one from that of rescinding contracts <span class='line-break'> </span>made many months since, upon which</p>

<p>considerable sums of money have been <span class='line-break'> </span>paid for work already done.

<p>The majority of the Committee are of <span class='line-break'> </span>opinion that is is expedient to go on with <span class='line-break'> </span>the Contracts made for the acquisition of <span class='line-break'> </span>the three Statues of <a href='/pages/subjects/60946' title='James Winthrop Statue'>John Winthrop</a>, <span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/54268' title='James Otis Statue'>James Otis</a> and <a href='/pages/subjects/52561' title='John Adams Statue'>John Adams</a>;- And <span class='line-break'> </span>they are also of opinion that in future <span class='line-break'> </span><del>that</del> all appropriations for the embellish<span class='line-break'></span>ment and improvement of the Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>be restricted to such objects as may be <span class='line-break'> </span>deemed essential;-</p>
