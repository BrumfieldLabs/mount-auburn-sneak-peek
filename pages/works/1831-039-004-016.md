<p>To the Trustees of Mt. Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Gentlemen</p>
<p>I have received your letter o the 15<sup>t</sup> of Feb<sup>ry</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>informing me that "The Trustees cannot consent to an <span class='line-break'> </span>extension of the time" originally agreed upon as the <span class='line-break'> </span>period allowed for the completion of the <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'>statue of <span class='line-break'> </span>my Father</a>. That "The Trustees will be pleased to <span class='line-break'> </span>act in concert with <a href='/pages/subjects/53238' title='Story, William W.'>Mr Story</a> respecting the substi<span class='line-break'></span>tution of American marble, if <a href='/pages/subjects/53238' title='Story, William W.'>Mr Story</a> &amp; the Trus<span class='line-break'></span>tees can be satisfied respecting it, &amp;  the use of it <span class='line-break'> </span>will not occasion any delay " &amp; That " it is the wish <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Trustees that the full-sized model should<span class='line-break'> </span>be made and exhibited to them with the least possible<span class='line-break'> </span>delay."</p>
<p>From the action of the Trustees, there <span class='line-break'> </span>seems to have been a misapprehension of the facts<span class='line-break'> </span>connected with my last letter to them  - &amp; also of the <span class='line-break'> </span>purpose of that letter - I deem it first to myself<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>to say that it was written expressly at the instance<span class='line-break'> </span>and at the request of <a href='/pages/subjects/52529' title='Bigelow, Jacob'>Dr. Bigelow</a>.  He came to me <span class='line-break'> </span>as I understood on the part of the Trustees to suggest<span class='line-break'> </span>the propriety of a modification of the Contract in <span class='line-break'> </span>respect to the marble &amp; the time - and to learn my<span class='line-break'> </span>views and intentions in respect to the making of the <span class='line-break'> </span>statue. Some conversation took place in which I<span class='line-break'> </span>stated my views fully - said that I had never <span class='line-break'> </span>asked for a change in the contract - but as the Trus<span class='line-break'></span>tees were desirous that the American marble should <span class='line-break'> </span>be used, the contract must be altered so as to enable <span class='line-break'> </span>me to comply with their wishes - that as to the <span class='line-break'> </span>time allotted for the execution of the work, although I <span class='line-break'> </span>expected to finish it according to the contract, yet <span class='line-break'> </span>since an extension of the time had been sug<span class='line-break'></span>gested, it would be most agreeable to me as it would <span class='line-break'> </span>free me from certain considerations which might other<span class='line-break'></span>wise embarrass me.  At the period of this conversa<span class='line-break'></span>tion my model had been exhibited to the trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; a meeting had been <del>called</del> <sup>proposed</sup> by the committee<span class='line-break'> </span>in my  presence for the express purpose of accepting <span class='line-break'> </span>or rejecting it.  <a href='/pages/subjects/52529' title='Bigelow, Jacob'>Dr. Bigelow</a> requested me to write</p>

<p>a letter to the Trustees embodying the views<span class='line-break'> </span>expressed in this conversation, - I declined at first <span class='line-break'> </span>and thought it unnecessary-  I did not wish to <span class='line-break'> </span>do anything which might be thought like begging<span class='line-break'> </span>and a letter might make it seem as if these propo<span class='line-break'></span>sitions of change originated with me - which was not <span class='line-break'> </span>the case.  But I consented at last.  The letter which <span class='line-break'> </span>I wrote was, as I understood, to be read at the <span class='line-break'> </span>meeting, as wholly incidental to its main object <span class='line-break'></span>viz - of accepting or rejecting my model.</p>
<p>The trustees at that meeting took no no<span class='line-break'></span>tice of the model, either by way of approbation,<span class='line-break'> </span>criticism, or rejections.  They merely stated their wish <span class='line-break'> </span>"that the full sized model should be made of &amp; exhibi<span class='line-break'> </span>ted to them without <del>delay</del> the least possible delay"<span class='line-break'> </span>I do not know that I am <ins>bound</ins> by the <ins>con<span class='line-break'></span>tract</ins> to comply with this "wish" in any way- al<span class='line-break'></span>though it would give no pleasure to meet the wishes<span class='line-break'> </span>of the committee as far as I am able.  If the <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'><!--Story-->statue</a><span class='line-break'> </span>be made in Italy it will be impossible to com<span class='line-break'></span>ply with their wish - as to the <ins>exhibition</ins> of the full<span class='line-break'> </span>sized model, &amp; this vote would force me to make it <span class='line-break'> </span>here.  But I have already exhibited the model<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>to them - a model much larger &amp; more finished than <span class='line-break'> </span>is the custom of artists to make or exhibit, &amp; which<span class='line-break'> </span>is amply sufficient to enable any one to determine <span class='line-break'> </span>whether it is satisfactory or not.  The exhibition of <span class='line-break'> </span>a <ins>full sized</ins> model was  never contemplated -   and <span class='line-break'> </span>I have certainly done at least all that the con<span class='line-break'></span>tract requires.  A model of this size certainly en<span class='line-break'></span>ables them to understand the design &amp; treatment of <span class='line-break'> </span>the <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'><!--Story-->statue</a> in every way better than <ins>drawings</ins> could.<span class='line-break'> </span>If I had not thought so, I should certainly not <span class='line-break'> </span>have put myself to the expense of transmitting it <span class='line-break'> </span>across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The present [adieu?] of the Trustees leaves <span class='line-break'> </span>me in doubt whether the Trustees wish a full<span class='line-break'></span>sized copy of <ins>this</ins> model to be made or a different <span class='line-break'> </span>model.-  I have every reason to infer from their si<span class='line-break'></span>lence on this head, that the present model is un<span class='line-break'></span>satisfactory.</p>
<p>The tone of the votes strongly indicates<span class='line-break'> </span>a disapprobation of the course I have pursued &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>of my "delay" in making the <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'><!--Story-->statue</a>.  There has <span class='line-break'> </span>as yet been no breach of contract on my part &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>if the votes were intended to reflect upon my course</p>

<p>they were at least uncalled for.  But I am not <span class='line-break'> </span>concious of <del>having</del> being guilty of any unnecessary <span class='line-break'> </span>"delay".

I confess that I rather sought to do my <span class='line-break'> </span>work well, than quickly.  I have spent much time<span class='line-break'> </span>thought and study upon it - carried it for nine years <span class='line-break'> </span>constantly in my mind - made two models &amp; many <span class='line-break'> </span>drawings and endeavored by practice in the art<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; by study or examination of all the best models <span class='line-break'> </span>abroad to prepare myself fully to do it.  I do <span class='line-break'> </span>not regret the "delay."  I think it was necessary <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; proper.  In so doing I supposed myself con<span class='line-break'></span>sulting the wishes of the Trustees as much as my <span class='line-break'> </span>own.

<p>quality &amp; size has thus far rendered the completion<span class='line-break'> </span>of the <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'><!--Story-->statue</a> impossible.

<p>After mature consideration I have come <span class='line-break'> </span>to the conclusion - in view of the apparent dissatis<span class='line-break'></span>faction of the Trustees as to what I have done &amp; what<span class='line-break'> </span>I propose to do - to offer to resign to them the com<span class='line-break'></span>mision to make this <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'><!--Story-->statue</a>, so as to enable them to <span class='line-break'> </span>place it in the hands of some artists who will better<span class='line-break'> </span>be able to carry out their views.
