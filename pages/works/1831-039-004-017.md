<p><a href='/pages/subjects/53238' title='Story, William W.'>W.W. Story</a> Esq<span class='line-break'> </span>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The Trustees of Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery have received from you a<span class='line-break'> </span>communication relative to a pedestal for the<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'>statue of the late Judge Story</a> executed by yourself.</p>
<p>The Trustees are of opinion that there<span class='line-break'> </span>are many varieties of American marble which<span class='line-break'> </span>would answer very well the purpose of a pedestal,<span class='line-break'> </span>and they believe that the execution of such a work<span class='line-break'> </span>here would serve equally well to be much<span class='line-break'> </span>cheaper than its execution in Italy and transportation<span class='line-break'> </span>to this country.</p>
<p>If therefore you will furnish them<span class='line-break'> </span>with your views in regard to the form &amp; size<span class='line-break'> </span>of this pedestal, the Trustees will cause it to be<span class='line-break'> </span>executed here. Of if you wish to give your<span class='line-break'> </span>personal directions in the matter it can be delayed<span class='line-break'> </span>until your arrival in this country</p>
<p>You will gratify the Trustees by informing<span class='line-break'> </span>them of your views, also of the probable time of the<span class='line-break'> </span>arrival of yourself &amp; the statue in <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>Boston</a></p>
<p>I am, dear sir, very truly yours</p>
