<p>I have drawn on the Mount<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn cemetery company, through<span class='line-break'> </span>Packenham Hooker &amp; Co, according to<span class='line-break'> </span>contract, for the sum of fifteen <span class='line-break'> </span>hundred dollars, that being the <span class='line-break'> </span>second payment on the statue.</p>
<p>Mr Crawford has finished the <span class='line-break'> </span>Otis. He leaves tomorrow morning for<span class='line-break'> </span>America.</p>
