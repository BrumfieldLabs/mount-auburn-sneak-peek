<p><ins>Copy</ins></p>
<p><ins>To <a href='/pages/subjects/53577' title='Greenough, Richard S.'>RS Greenough</a></ins>) <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>Boston</a> <date when='1856-04-01'>April 1 1856</date></p>
<p>My dear sir</p>
<p>I have duly received your two letters<span class='line-break'> </span>from <a href='/pages/subjects/54374' title='Paris, France'>Paris</a> of <date when='1856-01-21'>Jany 21</date> &amp; <date when='1856-03-09'>March 9th</date>.</p>
<p>The pedestals have not yet arrived, but no doubt<span class='line-break'> </span>we may expect them soon.</p>
<p>I am gratified with the report of the successful<span class='line-break'> </span>progress of the <a href='/pages/subjects/60946' title='James Winthrop Statue'>Winthrop Statue</a>, &amp; have no doubt<span class='line-break'> </span>that it will do equal honor to the sculptor and<span class='line-break'> </span>the original. The latter probably never dreamt<span class='line-break'> </span>that his posthumous character was to be sustained<span class='line-break'> </span>by such able hands.</p>
<p>The colored panes are removed from the end<span class='line-break'> </span>windows of the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'>chapel</a>, &amp; also from the clerestory,<span class='line-break'> </span>replacing them with white glass except in the<span class='line-break'> </span>two large windows which being deeply recessed,<span class='line-break'> </span>do not strike the statues with their light.</p>
<p>I think when the plaster statue is complete,<span class='line-break'> </span>you had better send to <a href='/pages/subjects/54773' title='Curtis, Charles P.'>Mr Curtis</a> (or whoever<span class='line-break'> </span>is your correspondent here) a draft for the sum<span class='line-break'> </span>to which you are entitled by contract (say $1500.)<span class='line-break'> </span>payable in 3 days from sight, &amp; drawn on <a href='/pages/subjects/54274' title='Bond, George William'>George W.<span class='line-break'> </span>Bond</a>, Treasurer of Mount Auburn Cemetery. For the<span class='line-break'> </span>satisfaction of the Trustees you had better accompany<span class='line-break'> </span>your own announcement with the voucher--<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>of some well known Bostonian, or of the American<span class='line-break'> </span>Consul, that the plaster statue of full size is complete.<span class='line-break'> </span>The vouching party may at the same time witness<span class='line-break'> </span>its conveyance to the Trustees.</p>
<p>I saw lately in the papers that the casting of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Franklin Statue is successfully completed.<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/53586' title='Winthrop, Mr.'>Mr Winthrop</a> spoke to me about fixing the time of<span class='line-break'> </span>its inauguration.</p>
<p>Please learn from <a href='/pages/subjects/52560' title='Rogers, Randolph'>Mr Rogers</a> when we may<span class='line-break'> </span>expect to hear from him. I like his design very<span class='line-break'> </span>much, unless perhaps it should turn out that<span class='line-break'> </span>there is more force than grace in the attitude of<span class='line-break'> </span>the head. But I have so much confidence in his<span class='line-break'> </span>own taste and judgement, that I should by<span class='line-break'> </span>no means presume to interfere in the "properties"<span class='line-break'> </span>of which he is so good a judge.</p>
<p>I hear nothing from <a href='/pages/subjects/53236' title='Crawford, Thomas'>Mr Crawford</a> since<span class='line-break'> </span>his acceptance of our commission for <a href='/pages/subjects/54268' title='James Otis Statue'>James<span class='line-break'> </span>Otis</a>. Can you learn from him when we may<span class='line-break'> </span>expect his valuable attention to the subject.</p>
<p>We are ready to execute his contract, similar<span class='line-break'> </span>to your own &amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/52560' title='Rogers, Randolph'>Mr Rogers</a>' either of which<span class='line-break'> </span>can be copied. I have not written to him a<span class='line-break'> </span>second time, having heard some rumours of<span class='line-break'> </span>his intending to visit this country ere long.</p>
<p>Very truly &amp; sincerely yrs</p>
