<p><a href='/pages/subjects/52529' title='Bigelow, Jacob'>D<sup>r</sup> Bigelow</a><span class='line-break'> </span>My Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Far from suspecting <span class='line-break'> </span>that, as you said, you were <span class='line-break'> </span>"half asleep" when you drew<span class='line-break'> </span>up the articles of contract<span class='line-break'> </span>for <a href='/pages/subjects/60946' title='James Winthrop Statue'>Winthrops statue</a>, I should <span class='line-break'> </span>say that you were "wide<span class='line-break'> </span>awake."</p>
<p>If it were not<span class='line-break'> </span>that your time is more <span class='line-break'> </span>valuably employed, I <span class='line-break'> </span>should be inclined, seeing <span class='line-break'> </span>what a good contract<span class='line-break'> </span>you have aranged for</p>
<p>[page four -out of order - see entire document for order]</p>
<p>always understanding.<span class='line-break'> </span>that <a href='/pages/subjects/56255' title='Joseph Story Statue'>Storys statue</a> is<span class='line-break'> </span>the guide. For instance,<span class='line-break'> </span>If <a href='/pages/subjects/53237' title='Story, Joseph'>Judge Story</a> was 5 f 9 in<span class='line-break'> </span>in height &amp; his statue is<span class='line-break'> </span>6 f 6 in in height, Then<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/54375' title='Winthrop, John'>Gov Winthrop</a> being 6 f in<span class='line-break'> </span>height, would require his<span class='line-break'> </span>statue to be 6 f.9. &amp; say 2/5 in.</p>
<p>Fifth.</p>
<p>A penalty is attached to<span class='line-break'> </span>the failure of completion of<span class='line-break'> </span>the work within a given <span class='line-break'> </span>time. I think this a mis<span class='line-break'></span>take for several reasons.<span class='line-break'> </span>If an artist desires to defraud<span class='line-break'> </span>he has many more expedient<span class='line-break'> </span>means of doing so than by<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>the Corporation, to ask you<span class='line-break'> </span>to prepare one for me.<span class='line-break'> </span>Feeling that I must de<span class='line-break'></span>pend upon my own poor<span class='line-break'> </span>wits for the modifications<span class='line-break'> </span>of your note, I will<span class='line-break'> </span>put down my suggestions,<span class='line-break'> </span>as requested.</p>
<p>First. It will<span class='line-break'> </span>be necessary for me to<span class='line-break'> </span>model the head in<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>Boston</a>. here is the original<span class='line-break'> </span>portrait, which will be<span class='line-break'> </span>better than any copy.</p>
<p>Second. It is<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>highly</ins>  <ins>important</ins> that I<span class='line-break'> </span>should be left entirely free</p>
<p>[page three]</p>
<p>in regard to the treatment <span class='line-break'> </span>of my subject, and that,<span class='line-break'> </span>if after a mature con<span class='line-break'></span>sideration of the sub<span class='line-break'></span>ject, I should <del>feel its</del><span class='line-break'> </span>conclude to change, even <span class='line-break'> </span>from my study model,<span class='line-break'> </span>that I should be at<span class='line-break'> </span>liberty to do so.  Some<span class='line-break'></span>times we make several <span class='line-break'> </span>study models..</p>
<p>Third. It should<span class='line-break'> </span>be specified, that the statue<span class='line-break'> </span>is to be made of "first <span class='line-break'> </span>quality" marble</p>
<p>Fourth. The <span class='line-break'> </span>difference of size in the <span class='line-break'> </span>different subjects for statues,<span class='line-break'> </span>should be preserved in <span class='line-break'> </span>their respective statues;</p>
