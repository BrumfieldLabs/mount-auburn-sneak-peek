<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of<span class='line-break'> </span>the <date when='1844-12-14'>14th Dec.</date> last together with the lithographic outlines<span class='line-break'> </span>of the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'>cemetery chapel windows</a>, which were forwarded to<span class='line-break'> </span>me about the middle of last month. I feel highly gratified<span class='line-break'> </span>by the proof which your letter affords of the estimation in<span class='line-break'> </span>which my professional skill is held by you, and I have en<span class='line-break'></span>deavoured to evince my sense of the value of your good opinion<span class='line-break'> </span>by the thought which I have bestowed on a series of designs which<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be shortly forwarded. Your lithographic outlines I have<span class='line-break'> </span>put in to the hands of Messrs <a href='/pages/subjects/54295' title='Ballantine &amp; Allan'>Ballantine and Allan</a> of this city<span class='line-break'> </span>who have been selected by the Royal Commission of the Fine Arts<span class='line-break'> </span>to furnish the painted glass for the principal portions of the New<span class='line-break'> </span>Houses of Parliament. These Gentlemen thus placed at<span class='line-break'> </span>the head of their profession, are intimate friends of mine<span class='line-break'> </span>and they are now engaged under my instructions in making<span class='line-break'> </span>the designs you require. I have requested them to forward <span class='line-break'> </span>you also an estimate of the cost of executing these designs<span class='line-break'> </span>in painted glass in the best manner, and I would<span class='line-break'> </span>strongly advise you to commit the matter intirely [sic] to them.<span class='line-break'> </span>Their work in brilliancy and harmony of colour equals<span class='line-break'> </span>the best specimens of the antique, and far excells them<span class='line-break'> </span>in symmetrical proportion, as well as in accurate<span class='line-break'> </span>drawing. No water coloured sketch can convey a<span class='line-break'> </span>correct idea of the effect of painted ^glass. Neither can</p>

<p>it be expected that manufacturers of painted glass<span class='line-break'> </span>such as you describe those in your neighbourhood <span class='line-break'> </span>to be, will be qualified to execute the work from<span class='line-break'> </span>the drawing that will be sent you. I know that<span class='line-break'> </span>my friends here will furnish you with the windows<span class='line-break'> </span>at the lowest remunerating rate, and in the event<span class='line-break'> </span>of your employing them, I am convinced that these<span class='line-break'> </span>productions will prove equally creditable to your taste<span class='line-break'> </span>and their abilities.</p>
<p>Should anything, <del>more</del> in my own line, be re<span class='line-break'></span>quired, such as, scrolls for the walls with illuminated<span class='line-break'> </span>mottos, which I generally do in oil painting and<span class='line-break'> </span>gilding upon a cloth or paper medium, and <span class='line-break'> </span>which can be easily and permanently fixed to<span class='line-break'> </span>the wall with white lead by any common painters,<span class='line-break'> </span>I shall be most happy to supply them.</p>
<p>Trusting the sketches which follow this will meet<span class='line-break'> </span>your approval, and apologizing for the delay which<span class='line-break'> </span>has occurred between your letter and my reply</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
