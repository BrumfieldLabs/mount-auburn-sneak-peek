<p><a href='/pages/subjects/52529' title='Bigelow, Jacob'>Jacob Bigelow</a> Esq M D</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>In accordance with the desire of <a href='/pages/subjects/54310' title='Hay, D. R.'>Mr Hay</a>, whose<span class='line-break'> </span>opinion you had requested, as to the most advisable mode, of<span class='line-break'> </span>colouring the Glass for the Windows of the <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'>Auburn Cemetry [sic] Chapel</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>we now enclose you, a series of designs, together with estimates for<span class='line-break'> </span>the execution of the work, and shall feel happy if they meet<span class='line-break'> </span>your approval..</p>
<p>Our experience in Glass Painting has been considerable.<span class='line-break'> </span>We have studied carefully the best specimens of the Antique, in this<span class='line-break'> </span>country and on the Continent, and feel confident, that we can now<span class='line-break'> </span>produce windows, equally durable &amp; brilliant, with the best of those<span class='line-break'> </span>specimens, and more in accordance with the principle of harmony<span class='line-break'> </span>in form and colour.</p>
<p>Our designs and specimens, for the windows of the<span class='line-break'> </span>New House of Lords, at Westminster, have been approved of by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Royal Commission on the Fine Arts, and we are anxious to extend our<span class='line-break'> </span>reputation still further. We have therefore prepared the following<span class='line-break'> </span>Estimates, at the lowest remunerating rates, and should feel exceedingly<span class='line-break'> </span>delighted, to have the honour, and the advantage, through your<span class='line-break'> </span>means, of sending a specimen of our Art to your interesting<span class='line-break'> </span>country.-- You are no doubt aware that it is impossible to<span class='line-break'> </span>convey by a water coloured drawing, any idea of the effect of<span class='line-break'> </span>such designs, when properly executed in Glass, and ^that^ any attempt<span class='line-break'> </span>to transmit in writing instructions in Glass Painting is useless<span class='line-break'> </span>for any practical purpose.--</p>
<p>We may state that our Painted Glass is not<span class='line-break'> </span>executed on large Sheets, but like that of the Ancients is a <span class='line-break'> </span>species of Mosaic work -- For example, the central compartment of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Rose window, would be composed of upwards of one thousand<span class='line-break'> </span>separate pieces of Glass, the colour of which is in the body of<span class='line-break'> </span>the material, not merely fused on the surface -- This mode<span class='line-break'> </span>produces the most brilliant effect, is much stronger than any other<span class='line-break'> </span>and when any repair is required small pieces are easily inserted</p>

<p>Should you entrust the work to our care, we<span class='line-break'> </span>should guarantee that all the coloured glasses should be of the<span class='line-break'> </span>very finest quality, and that the workmanship should be equal<span class='line-break'> </span>to any other in Ancient or Modern Painted Glass. The pannels<span class='line-break'> </span>could be forwarded together with plans &amp; written instructions, <span class='line-break'> </span>such as would enable any common Glazier to put them in --<span class='line-break'> </span>Especial care would be taken that the Glass was packed <span class='line-break'> </span>in a way to warrant its safety -- Vessels leave <a href='/pages/subjects/54294' title='Greenock, Scotland'>Greenock</a><span class='line-break'> </span>every month for <a href='/pages/subjects/64140' title='New York, NY'>New York</a>, the carriage would not form an<span class='line-break'> </span>important item and we could have the entire work finished<span class='line-break'> </span>within six or eight months from the time of its commencement.</p>
<p>Should you resolve upon employing us, it<span class='line-break'> </span>would ensure correctness if you would forward pasteboard or<span class='line-break'> </span>paper shapes, the exact daylight sizes of the various compart<span class='line-break'></span>ments. These templets or shapes must be numbered, and your<span class='line-break'> </span>lithograph drawings numbered to correspond -- The shapes of the<span class='line-break'> </span>long perpendicular compartments would only be required above<span class='line-break'> </span>the springs of the Arches with the exact length of the<span class='line-break'> </span>compartments below the springs of Arches marked --</p>
<p>We have only to add that <a href='/pages/subjects/54310' title='Hay, D. R.'>Mr Hay</a> has been<span class='line-break'> </span>consulted in the general arrangement and details of the<span class='line-break'> </span>designs, that he has expressed his unqualified approbation <span class='line-break'> </span>of both, and that should you honour us with an order<span class='line-break'> </span>to execute the work, our chief aim would be to render the<span class='line-break'> </span>Painted Glass Windows of your <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a> interesting and <span class='line-break'> </span>attractive -- We have the honour to be</p>
