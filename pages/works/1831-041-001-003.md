<p>Gentlemen</p>
<p>I have the pleasure to<span class='line-break'> </span>acknowledge the receipt of your letter of <date when='1845-04-21'>21<sup>st</sup> April</date><span class='line-break'> </span>with the accompanying designs for colored windows.<span class='line-break'> </span>With a few exceptions, hereafter to be stated, these<span class='line-break'> </span>designs are approved and much admired, and<span class='line-break'> </span>you are requested immediately to make for us<span class='line-break'> </span>the two large windows conformably to the paper<span class='line-break'> </span>shapes or patterns which are ^now forwarded by <del>the</del><span class='line-break'> </span>Cambria steamer ^rolled up in a tin box, care of <a href='/pages/subjects/54307' title='Harnden &amp; Co.'>Harnden &amp; Co</a>, <a href='/pages/subjects/52562' title='Liverpool, UK'>Liverpool</a>, and will reach you<span class='line-break'> </span>soon <del>in a few days</del> after this letter.</p>
<p><span class='depth3' depth='3' title='Nave Window.'>Nave Window.</span></p>
<p>Please to notice that the cast iron window<span class='line-break'> </span>frames, which are now made, have undergone<span class='line-break'> </span>some slight alterations from the lithographic<span class='line-break'> </span>designs. The great circular central space in<span class='line-break'> </span>the Nave window has 12 hemicircles, or<span class='line-break'> </span>indentations instead of 8, and the small arches ^are higher &amp; more acute<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; have also more hemicircles. All this appears<span class='line-break'> </span>in the paper daylight patterns, which you will<span class='line-break'> </span>follow exactly. ^The mullions are shorter now than in the lithograph plan.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Rose window is unaltered.</p>
<p>In the Nave window you will fill the <span class='line-break'> </span>large perpendicular lights and all the smaller</p>

<p>lights of the upper compartments, exactly as<span class='line-break'> </span>they ^<sup>now</sup> stand in your designs. But the great<span class='line-break'> </span>circular space in this window I wish filled, not<span class='line-break'> </span>with the resurrection piece in your design, but with<span class='line-break'> </span>an allegorical representation of <ins>Death</ins>, of which I send<span class='line-break'> </span>you a design, in the roll, copied mainly from<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/54296' title='Thorwaldsen, Bertel'>Thorwaldsens</a> Bas relief of Night, representing a<span class='line-break'> </span>winged sleeping female and two infants. It is the<span class='line-break'> </span>most beautiful &amp; appropriate thing I <del>ever saw</del> have seen.</p>
<p>In the Rose window you will substitute<span class='line-break'> </span>in the centre a design which is also inclosed in the<span class='line-break'> </span>roll, and which is allegorical of <ins>Immortality</ins>. It<span class='line-break'> </span>is copied from the two cherubs in <a href='/pages/subjects/54297' title='Raphael, Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino'>Raphaels</a> Madonna<span class='line-break'> </span>del Sisto, who are here represented as gazing upwards<span class='line-break'> </span>into a light or glory, which proceeds from an invisible<span class='line-break'> </span>source. <a href='/pages/subjects/54297' title='Raphael, Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino'>Raphaels</a> picture is at Dresden. Some parts<span class='line-break'> </span>of it, especially the cherub wings, are highly colored.<span class='line-break'> </span>If you have good copies in <a href='/pages/subjects/54292' title='Edinburgh, Scotland'>Edinburgh</a>, please to<span class='line-break'> </span>imitate them, paying all attention to keep the expression of the faces.</p>
<p>Allow me to suggest an opinion that<span class='line-break'> </span>the representation of Death in the northern window<span class='line-break'> </span>should be executed in cold or sombre tints;<span class='line-break'> </span>that of Immortality which fronts the sun, should<span class='line-break'> </span>be in bright &amp; dazzling colors. The field, or back<span class='line-break'> </span>ground I leave to be managed by your own judgement<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
