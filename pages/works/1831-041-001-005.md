<p>Sir,</p>
<p>We have the pleasure to acknowledge the<span class='line-break'> </span>receipt of the pattern shapes for Windows of <a href='/pages/subjects/53239' title='Bigelow Chapel'><!--Bigelow-->Chapel</a>, &amp; under<span class='line-break'></span>stand sufficiently those for the Rose window, but require<span class='line-break'> </span>still some explanation regarding the dimensions of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Nave and Aisle Windows -</p>
<p>You state that "the shapes cut by the<span class='line-break'> </span>mechanic are of the exact size of the openings which are to<span class='line-break'> </span>receive the Glass, and that if a sheet of Glass was cut <span class='line-break'> </span>exactly by one of the patterns it would pass freely through<span class='line-break'> </span>the opening"  The person who has cut the shapes states<span class='line-break'> </span>that the patterns for the Nave &amp; Aisle Windows are the right<span class='line-break'> </span>size to fit the rabit, and that if a metal rim or sash<span class='line-break'> </span>is put round it must not exceed the size of the pattern<span class='line-break'> </span>sent"</p>
<p>There is thus you will observe an apparent contradiction<span class='line-break'> </span>in the statement, which prevents us from being able<span class='line-break'> </span>to understand exactly what is meant.â€”</p>
<p><ins>You</ins></p>
