<p>Gentlemen</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Steamer<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambria last evening, in the short passage of 11 days,<span class='line-break'> </span>I am enabled to answer by tomorrow's steamer, your<span class='line-break'> </span>favours of the <date when='1845-07-02'>2<sup>d</sup></date> &amp; <date when='1845-07-15'>15<sup>th</sup></date> inst.... In reply to your<span class='line-break'> </span>inquiries. The sheets of glass are to be exactly of the<span class='line-break'> </span>size of the paper patterns. But if there is a metal <span class='line-break'> </span>rim put round the glass by you, it is to be considered<span class='line-break'> </span>as part of the glass, so that the whole diameter shall<span class='line-break'> </span>not exceed that of the paper pattern. We shall add to the<span class='line-break'> </span>cast iron of the long windows, a small wooden rebat,<span class='line-break'> </span>up which the glass, or lead, will be cemented. It will<span class='line-break'> </span>project over the glass about a quarter ^1/4 of an inch or<span class='line-break'> </span>3/8.</p>
<p>By referring to my letter of <date when='1845-06-14'>June 14<sup>th</sup></date> you<span class='line-break'> </span>will find that in the Nave window, the whole daylight<span class='line-break'> </span>space between the mullions is 12 feet 10 inches in <span class='line-break'> </span>height, measuring from the bottom of the bases,<span class='line-break'> </span>to the tops of the caps of the mullions. (see an accom<span class='line-break'></span>panying plan.) From this height you may deduct<span class='line-break'> </span>about 1 1/2 inch for the width of a crossbar at<span class='line-break'> </span>bottom, &amp; you will then have the height to where<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>In the same letter you will find that the height<span class='line-break'> </span>of the mullions in the aisle windows is 8 feet from<span class='line-break'> </span>the tops of the bases to the bottom of the caps.</p>
<p>The caps &amp; bases measure together 9 inches, making<span class='line-break'> </span>the total daylight up to the paper patterns 8 feet 9 inches.</p>
