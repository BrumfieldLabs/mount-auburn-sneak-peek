<p>6<span class='line-break'></span>Mt Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Boston Oct 22 1831</p>
<p>My dear sir</p>
<p>I have perused your valuable <span class='line-break'> </span>document on the history &amp;c of Mount Auburn,<span class='line-break'> </span>and agreeably to your wish that I should "put <span class='line-break'> </span>the whole into such shape as may be deemed <span class='line-break'> </span>most expedient"  I have prepared a condensed <span class='line-break'> </span>draught, setting forth the principal facts and <span class='line-break'> </span>circumstances of which it seemed necessary that <span class='line-break'> </span>the public should be informed, and omitting <span class='line-break'> </span>that which appeared of minor importance.</p>
<p>As the public may not think it decorous <span class='line-break'> </span>that the committee should eulogize themselves, <span class='line-break'> </span>I have omitted what is said in regard to <span class='line-break'> </span>myself, and also in regard to the private movements <span class='line-break'> </span>of others of the committee; - and have recorded <span class='line-break'> </span>in connexion with names, only the <u>official</u> &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span><u>public</u> proceedings which have taken place.  In these<span class='line-break'> </span>I believe the names of all the founders &amp; promoters <span class='line-break'> </span>of the design are introduced with sufficient <span class='line-break'> </span>distinctness, &amp; we may avoid censorious criticisms <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; ill natured remarks. -<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<div class="page-content">
<p>As the general character and usefulness <span class='line-break'> </span>of the design are abundantly set forth in Judge <span class='line-break'> </span>Story's address, and as the public has been <span class='line-break'> </span>fully informed on these subjects through the <span class='line-break'> </span>newspapers, it does not seem to me necessary to <span class='line-break'> </span>reprint much of what has published before in <span class='line-break'> </span>successive newspapers, excepting however, those things<span class='line-break'> </span>which it is neessary for subscribers to consult, <span class='line-break'> </span>such as the act of <del>incorp</del>the legislature, &amp; the <span class='line-break'> </span>terms of the subscription.  As the Judges address<span class='line-break'> </span>is sufficiently eloquent &amp; ornamented, it is proper <span class='line-break'> </span>that our appendix should be simply historical &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>explanatory, &amp; that it should not compete with <span class='line-break'> </span>him for the palm, either in <del>style</del>richness of <span class='line-break'> </span>style, or number of pages.</p>
<p>I shall be glad of your opinion as to the <span class='line-break'> </span>correctness of what is said, by way of general <span class='line-break'> </span>description, on the last pages;  also as to any omissions <span class='line-break'> </span>or additions requisite.  The <u>address</u> is now in the <span class='line-break'> </span>printers hand, and the rest may be added as soon <span class='line-break'> </span>as you return me the papers</p>
<p>with sincere respect &amp; esteem<span class='line-break'> </span>Yours truly<span class='line-break'> </span>Jacob Bigelow</p>
<p>Gen Dearborn</p>

<p>P.S.  It occurs to me to say, that in <span class='line-break'> </span>staking out the lots, they should not be made <span class='line-break'> </span>to include large trees within their limits, -<span class='line-break'> </span>since the digging hereafter to be made would cut <span class='line-break'> </span>off the roots &amp; endanger their falling</p>

<p>Monday 11. A M.  I have received your letter<span class='line-break'> </span>and approve its contents.  <u>Indian </u><u>Path</u> strikes me well.<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Brimmer prefers <u>Indian </u><u>Ridge</u><span class='line-break'> </span>Immediately on receiving your letter I went <span class='line-break'> </span>to Mr Wadsworth but found he had already <span class='line-break'> </span>printed a few names, &amp; among the rest<span class='line-break'> </span>Central avenue. - As we shall <span class='line-break'> </span>probably cultivate the shrubs &amp;c. on the <span class='line-break'> </span>avenues which bear their names, I <span class='line-break'> </span>have introduced some <u>hardy</u> species, in <span class='line-break'> </span>the place of Green house plants -<span class='line-break'> </span>such as <u>LilacPath</u>, <u>Osier</u>,<u>Catalpa</u><span class='line-break'> </span><u>Linden</u>, <u>Holly</u> &amp;c -</p>
<p>I agree with you that Partridge hill should be <span class='line-break'> </span>changed</p>
