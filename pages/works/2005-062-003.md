<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I send you 50 pro<span class='line-break'></span>prietors tickets.</p>
<p>Also deeds for <a href='/pages/subjects/59188' title='Bradford, Duncan'>Duncan Bradford, Esq<sup>r</sup></a>,<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/59189' title='Faden, Mary A.'>Mary A. Faden</a>, and of Passageway to<span class='line-break'> </span>Eunice M. [Condly?]</p>
<p>The deed ordered in name of Charlotte<span class='line-break'> </span>[Gynand?] cannot be made without putting<span class='line-break'> </span>the title of the lot in her name. By refer<span class='line-break'></span>ring to the catalogue you will perceive<span class='line-break'> </span>she only represents it. I believe <a href='/pages/subjects/54833' title='Bowditch, J. Ingersoll'>J. Ingersoll<span class='line-break'> </span>Bowditch</a> is one of the Trustees under the<span class='line-break'> </span>wills - a man impatient of forms - and<span class='line-break'> </span>I should not be surprized if he sh<sup>d</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>refuse to do anything about it. The<span class='line-break'> </span>addition should be conveyed to the party<span class='line-break'> </span>in whom the legal estate of the lot has<span class='line-break'> </span>vested.</p>
<p>Is there not some mistake about<span class='line-break'> </span>the passagway to <a href='/pages/subjects/54772' title='Gould, Benjamin A. (1787-1859)'>B.A. Gould</a> which<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr Mann</a> has described?

(1787-1859)'>Mr. Gould</a>'s lifetime this whole<span class='line-break'> </span>space about 9 to 11 ft. was divided between<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/54772' title='Gould, Benjamin A.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>When you last called<span class='line-break'> </span>at my office about the bill<span class='line-break'> </span>due to Mt Auburn, you said<span class='line-break'> </span>you would see <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr. Mann</a> the<span class='line-break'> </span>Sup<sup>t</sup>, and attend to it. This was<span class='line-break'> </span>some months since. I have<span class='line-break'> </span>asked the Sup<sup>t</sup> several times if<span class='line-break'> </span>you had seen him, and he<span class='line-break'> </span>said , <ins>no</ins>; and that he did not<span class='line-break'> </span>consider that he had anything<span class='line-break'> </span>to do about bill placed in<span class='line-break'> </span>my hands for collection.</p>
<p>I must consequently again<span class='line-break'> </span>call your attention to this unset<span class='line-break'></span>tled account, and request<span class='line-break'> </span>that you neglect it no longer.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p><a href='/pages/subjects/85149' title='Ordway, John P.'>Mr John P. Ordway</a>,</p>
<p>Your note of <date when='1860-10-05'>Oct 5</date> is before<span class='line-break'> </span>me—in which you say—this "I shall<span class='line-break'> </span>be absent for about a week<span class='line-break'> </span>longer, after which time will see<span class='line-break'> </span>you."</p>
<p>Twenty Eight days or <ins>four</ins> weeks<span class='line-break'> </span>have elapsed without your fulfilling<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>this</ins> promise—like many that have<span class='line-break'> </span>gone before it. Now this may<span class='line-break'> </span>all be innocent enough on your<span class='line-break'> </span>part, but I have come to the<span class='line-break'> </span>opinion that it is mere imposition,<span class='line-break'> </span>and unworthy of both of us. You<span class='line-break'> </span>have, at various times, intimated <span class='line-break'> </span>that you were ready to arrange<span class='line-break'> </span>a place for gradual payment;<span class='line-break'> </span>and this you have totally neglected.</p>
<p>I shall bring the matter to the<span class='line-break'> </span>attention of the Trustees next Monday,<span class='line-break'> </span>and let them say what they think<span class='line-break'> </span>should be done.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I have seen <a href='/pages/subjects/59191' title='Mann, Jonathan'>Mr<span class='line-break'> </span>Mann,</a> and sought an expla<span class='line-break'></span>nation of the changes made upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the plan, or rather, required to be<span class='line-break'> </span>made by his mistake in not <span class='line-break'> </span>using the old numbers.

<p>The <a href='/pages/subjects/59226' title='Lot 3013'>number 3013</a> has been given to<span class='line-break'> </span>what was <a href='/pages/subjects/59227' title='Lot 537'><!--Lot-->537</a> on Olive Path, and<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/59228' title='Lot 3054'><!--Lot-->3054</a> to what was <a href='/pages/subjects/59229' title='Lot 2139'><!--Lot-->2139</a> (not<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/59230' title='Lot 2137'><!--Lot-->2137</a> as you state) on Hibiscus Path.</p>
<p>As nobody has been harmed, <span class='line-break'> </span>I see no need of going to the Trus<span class='line-break'></span>tees -but simply to erase a <ins>location</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>opposite to the old numbers in the<span class='line-break'> </span>catalogue, and put the new number in<span class='line-break'> </span>the plan in place of the old.

<p>Yours of yesterday is<span class='line-break'> </span>rec<sup>d</sup>.

Your inference is that as $2 of<span class='line-break'> </span>the $7 in 1859 was for painting, that'll<span class='line-break'> </span>care of the lot for 1860, <ins>without</ins> painting<span class='line-break'> </span>sh<sup>d</sup> be [both?] $5.

<p>I enclose the card of our new <ins>gar<span class='line-break'></span>dener</ins> - an office additional to Superintendent of<span class='line-break'> </span>lots is well spoken of &amp; I doubt not would<span class='line-break'> </span>do rightly by you, if you wish to commit<span class='line-break'> </span>the care of your lot to him.</p>

<p>"Voted that the Committee on<span class='line-break'> </span>Grounds be instructed by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Board to give notice to the con<span class='line-break'></span>tractors for the granite front of<span class='line-break'> </span>the <a href='/pages/subjects/59983' title='Hazel Dell'>new catacomb tombs</a> in<span class='line-break'> </span>course of construction between<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/59984' title='Rosebay Avenue'>Rosebay<!--Ave--></a> and <a href='/pages/subjects/59985' title='Culvert Avenue'>Culvert Ave<span class='line-break'></span>nues</a>, that this Corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>will not accept said granite<span class='line-break'> </span>front on account of imperfections<span class='line-break'> </span>in the stones, and for defective<span class='line-break'> </span>construction."</p>

<p><a href='/pages/subjects/59986' title='Bacon, William B.'>W<sup>m</sup>. B. Bacon</a> Esq</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>It appears from<span class='line-break'> </span>a recent interment in <a href='/pages/subjects/59987' title='Bacon, Danielo G.'>Mr D.G. Bacon's</a><span class='line-break'> </span>lot in Mt Auburn, that your<span class='line-break'> </span>numbers upon the lot have not<span class='line-break'> </span>been made to correspond with<span class='line-break'> </span>those of your deeds, and as in the<span class='line-break'> </span>Catalogue of Proprietors. I have<span class='line-break'> </span>ascertained that the numbers<span class='line-break'> </span>have been cut upon the Stone;<span class='line-break'> </span>hence it is impracticable to attempt<span class='line-break'> </span>correction there.</p>
<p>The only course, therefore, left<span class='line-break'> </span>for you is to transfer your deed<span class='line-break'> </span>to your brother, &amp; he the same to<span class='line-break'> </span>you. Unless you do this, some<span class='line-break'> </span>future interment will be the occasion<span class='line-break'> </span>of a mortifying blunder by opening a<span class='line-break'> </span>grave in the wrong lot.</p>
<p>I will attend to the matter for<span class='line-break'> </span>you at any time; but shall have<span class='line-break'> </span>to charge you for the<span class='line-break'> </span>record.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>

<p>It is doubtless, as you remark, unusual for<span class='line-break'> </span>one to put on record the evidence of his title, <span class='line-break'> </span>to real estate.  This usually becomes apparent from<span class='line-break'> </span>his possession.

Every lot owner, I think, will<span class='line-break'> </span>see, upon a moment's reflection, how necessary is the<span class='line-break'> </span>proper record of these titles, that the officers and<span class='line-break'> </span>servants of the Corporation may have the requisite<span class='line-break'> </span>knowledge to guide them in their duties, as none of<span class='line-break'> </span>them can be supposed to have so wide an acquaintence<span class='line-break'> </span>with mankind as to remove this necessity.</p>

<p>You will remember that it was<span class='line-break'> </span>opened last week for <a href='/pages/subjects/60341' title='Wyman, Lizzie Aspinwall'>Dr. Wyman's daugh<span class='line-break'></span>ter</a>. This lot &amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/60342' title='Lot 296'>296,</a> that of<a href='/pages/subjects/60343' title='Howe, Joseph N.'> Jos.<span class='line-break'> </span>N. Howe</a> are together without any<span class='line-break'> </span>passage between, and measure 900f.<span class='line-break'> </span>or 450 f. each. - We drove stakes<span class='line-break'> </span>thirty feet each way - making 120 linear<span class='line-break'> </span>feet round the lots.</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/60339' title='Wyman, Rufus'>Mr Wyman</a> would like to have<span class='line-break'> </span>you make an estimate on filling and<span class='line-break'> </span>grading up somewhat, and putting a<span class='line-break'> </span>suitable curb round the lots. <span class='line-break'> </span>The monument is so large and bold,<span class='line-break'> </span>that all the parties interested<span class='line-break'> </span>have come to the conclusion that<span class='line-break'> </span>no enclosure other than a curb<span class='line-break'> </span>will answer the purposes. I sug<span class='line-break'></span>gested it was possible to put a<span class='line-break'> </span>suitable curb on at $2 per foot -<span class='line-break'> </span>but was not certain that that<span class='line-break'> </span>sum would put one on heavy<span class='line-break'> </span>enough for so large an area.</p>
<p>He thinks it would do to fill up<span class='line-break'> </span>a foot. I don't know whether the<span class='line-break'> </span>monument would bear so much -<span class='line-break'> </span>should doubt it: but it ought to<span class='line-break'> </span>come up enough to protect it from<span class='line-break'> </span>parties crossing to &amp; from the Indian<span class='line-break'> </span>Ridge.</p>
<p>I wish you would look at<span class='line-break'> </span>the lots, if the snow is down enough, and<span class='line-break'> </span>make up your mind what would look<span class='line-break'> </span>best, and make some estimate on<span class='line-break'> </span>the thing.

<p>He, however, did not regard<span class='line-break'> </span>it as good ground for changing the<span class='line-break'> </span>decision of the Comm<sup>ee</sup>, as the prop<sup>r</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>or his agent should have insisted<span class='line-break'> </span>on his rights while it was an open<span class='line-break'> </span>question. He says the land is<span class='line-break'> </span>there - it was yours to use or not<span class='line-break'> </span>as you saw fit - that the<span class='line-break'> </span>the land is there still but of<span class='line-break'> </span>no use to the Corporation as it<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot be sold.</p>
<p>I felt very sure such would<span class='line-break'> </span>be the view taken, and therefore<span class='line-break'> </span>preferred you should see the Comm<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>yourself, as I prefer that you should<span class='line-break'> </span>have the opportunity of satisfying your<span class='line-break'></span>self that the subject has been fairly<span class='line-break'> </span>presented, which you can hardly have<span class='line-break'> </span>without acting as your own counsel.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to urge the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>further, I suppose you will be ready<span class='line-break'> </span>to pay the Treas<sup>r</sup> the bill due<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The Committee on Lots<span class='line-break'> </span>have considered the questions whether<span class='line-break'> </span>they will guarantee the <ins>perpetual</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>care of the lot of the late <a href='/pages/subjects/59944' title='Ward, Winthrop'>Winthrop<span class='line-break'> </span>Ward</a> for the sum specified in<span class='line-break'> </span>his will; and have unanimously<span class='line-break'> </span>come to the conclusion that they<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot give such guaranty for <span class='line-break'> </span>less than $600. The monument<span class='line-break'> </span>is quite elaborate, and they are<span class='line-break'> </span>unwilling to assume the risk for<span class='line-break'> </span>less than the sum named.-</p>
<p>But they are willing to receive<span class='line-break'> </span>the $300 named in the will on<span class='line-break'> </span>the usual terms stated in the<span class='line-break'> </span>by-laws, <ins>without</ins> their guaranty<span class='line-break'> </span>of perpetual care. In this case,<span class='line-break'> </span>they simply expend the income,<span class='line-break'> </span>in hand so there still be of<span class='line-break'> </span>no use to the responsible beyond<span class='line-break'> </span>amount - nor for the care<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot beyond the failure of<span class='line-break'> </span>the fund, if it should ever become<span class='line-break'> </span>worthless by no fault of theirs.</p>
<p>Proprietors, however, often consider<span class='line-break'> </span>a donation in this way perfectly<span class='line-break'> </span>safe. There are more in number,<span class='line-break'> </span>that wish the guaranty.-</p>
<p>But I do not understand<span class='line-break'> </span>the clause of <a href='/pages/subjects/59944' title='Ward, Winthrop'>Mr Ward's</a> will<span class='line-break'> </span>on this subject as requiring<span class='line-break'> </span>a guaranty. He certainly took<span class='line-break'> </span>the responsibility of giving $300,<span class='line-break'> </span>without inquiring of the other<span class='line-break'> </span>party to contract for guaranty<span class='line-break'> </span>of perpetual repair, and must<span class='line-break'> </span>therefore be presumed not to have<span class='line-break'> </span>intended that to be required, as we<span class='line-break'> </span>must also suppose that he had<span class='line-break'> </span>seen the by-laws in print.-</p>
<p>If you prefer to make up the amount<span class='line-break'> </span>to what the Comm<sup>ee</sup> name, such a<span class='line-break'> </span>contract can be made.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, The subject referred to in the<span class='line-break'> </span>accompanying circular is not now for the first time<span class='line-break'> </span>brought to the notice of the "Pres. &amp; Fellows"</p>
<p>I find upon the records of our Board of Trustees,<span class='line-break'> </span>three years since (<date when='1859-02'>Feby. 1859.</date>) the following as the Report of a<span class='line-break'> </span>Com<sup>ee</sup> to whom the subject was ref<sup>d</sup>.</p>
<p>"The Committee to whom was referred the memorial<span class='line-break'> </span>of <a href='/pages/subjects/60399' title='Lawrence, Amos Adams'>Mr Lawrence, Treas<sup>r</sup></a> of <a href='/pages/subjects/59943' title='Harvard College'>Harv<sup>d</sup> College</a>, respecting the <span class='line-break'> </span>boundaries of the lot in the Cemetery belonging to that Corpor<span class='line-break'></span>ation - with full power.</p>
<p>Reported that they had arranged with the Treas<span class='line-break'></span>urer of the College that said lot should be surveyed, and<span class='line-break'> </span>that is should be optional with him whether the monuments<span class='line-break'> </span>now said to encroach upon the lands of this Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>should be removed within the present bounds, or whether<span class='line-break'> </span>sufficient land should be exchanged from another<span class='line-break'> </span>part of said lot to be equivalent to the land now<span class='line-break'> </span>occupied by said monuments."</p>
<p>And the report was accepted - and here,<span class='line-break'> </span>it now appears, the matter ended. -</p>

<p>The result is- we have a plan of great beauty<span class='line-break'> </span>and accuracy, as yet without this lot being indicated.</p>
<p>Will you please bring this matter before the Corporation,<span class='line-break'> </span>and have such action taken as will vest in you this<span class='line-break'> </span>power, if need be, to do what is requisite when Spring<span class='line-break'> </span>opens.

<p>Dear Sir, It is some two or<span class='line-break'> </span>three years since the lot of the late <a href='/pages/subjects/60942' title='Larkin, Thomas C.'>Thos.<span class='line-break'> </span>C.

<p>As <a href='/pages/subjects/60943' title='Erving, Mr.'>Mr Erving</a> appeared to have no<span class='line-break'> </span>instructions but to deliver the deed, I<span class='line-break'> </span>said nothing to him about my services,<span class='line-break'> </span>and concluded it was best to<span class='line-break'> </span>suggest the matter directly to you<span class='line-break'> </span>only.

<p>I urged the sale to <a href='/pages/subjects/60944' title='Pierce, Mr.'>Mr Pierce</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>because I believed it as much<span class='line-break'> </span>for the interest of the Larkin<span class='line-break'> </span>Estate as for him - for it would<span class='line-break'> </span>be seldom that I could find<span class='line-break'> </span>a man willing to pay $500 for<span class='line-break'> </span>a lot situated just as this one<span class='line-break'> </span>is.

<p>I find the deed antedates the<span class='line-break'> </span>contract for repair of lot, but as<span class='line-break'> </span>that cont. same with the lot,<span class='line-break'> </span>regardless of ownership, the date is<span class='line-break'> </span>immaterial. -</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>At the meeting of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees of Mount Auburn held<span class='line-break'> </span>yesterday, the following vote was passed.</p>
<p>"That the Committee on Lots be<span class='line-break'> </span>authorized to grant to the purchasers<span class='line-break'> </span>of lots the privilege of constructing<span class='line-break'> </span>tombs and catacombs within the<span class='line-break'> </span>same at prices to be fixed by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Committee - not less than fifty dollars<span class='line-break'> </span>for each tomb or catacomb: - and they<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be further authorized to<span class='line-break'> </span>grant to proprietors of lots here<span class='line-break'></span>tofore purchased the same privilege<span class='line-break'> </span>at the same price, not less than <span class='line-break'> </span>fifty dollars for each tomb, which<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be constructed according<span class='line-break'> </span>to Articles 23<sup>d</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> of the By-laws."</p>
<p>By the foregoing you will see<span class='line-break'> </span>that $50, at least, is required to be<span class='line-break'> </span>paid in all cases, and that thus<span class='line-break'> </span>the old rule (or rather exception) of no<span class='line-break'> </span>charge in cases of <ins>catacomb</ins> tombs<span class='line-break'> </span>is virtually abrogated.-</p>

<p>In sending the ac<span class='line-break'></span>companying notice to some two or three<span class='line-break'> </span>hundred of our proprietors whose lots<span class='line-break'> </span>are therein described, your lot was<span class='line-break'> </span>casually overlooked - as it did not<span class='line-break'> </span>get on to my notes. But not only<span class='line-break'> </span>is <a href='/pages/subjects/63913' title='Lot 323'>Lot 323</a> deficient of proper bounds<span class='line-break'> </span>if it has any, but <a href='/pages/subjects/63914' title='Lot 1443'>lot 1443</a> - that<span class='line-break'> </span>of the late <a href='/pages/subjects/63915' title='Putnam, Samuel R.'>S.

The only<span class='line-break'> </span>plan however which we rely on does not<span class='line-break'> </span>contain it.

<p>It is therefore entirely evident that<span class='line-break'> </span>it must be laid out anew if it<span class='line-break'> </span>ever has been at all, [or where?]<span class='line-break'> </span>find a proof and this should<span class='line-break'> </span>be done previous to any other<span class='line-break'> </span>work that may be desired.</p>
<p>I made a verbal statement<span class='line-break'> </span>of this a few days since to your<span class='line-break'> </span>brother, <a href='/pages/subjects/63916' title='Lowell, James Russell'>James R.</a>, in consequence of<span class='line-break'> </span>receiving a written request from<span class='line-break'> </span>him that <a href='/pages/subjects/63917' title='O&apos;Brien'>O'Brien</a> should do<span class='line-break'> </span>some work on the lot: but he<span class='line-break'> </span>asked that I should put the<span class='line-break'> </span>statement in writing. While con<span class='line-break'></span>versing with him, it occurred to<span class='line-break'> </span>me, and I mentioned to him, that<span class='line-break'> </span>you were the representative of the lot - <span class='line-break'> </span>recently appointed upon the application,<span class='line-break'> </span>of the several heirs. I left him without<span class='line-break'> </span>any definite understanding of whether this<span class='line-break'> </span>matter would receive his attention,<span class='line-break'> </span>and therefore communicate the facts<span class='line-break'> </span>to you, as perhaps I ought to have <span class='line-break'> </span>done in the first instance, but as<span class='line-break'> </span>a matter of courtesy called on<span class='line-break'> </span>him.</p>

<p>The only course then that can be pursued is to<span class='line-break'> </span>apply to the Probate Court in the County where the estate is<span class='line-break'> </span>situated for the appointment of a guardian to the children:<span class='line-break'> </span>and that guardian must be an inhabitant of Mass<span class='line-break'></span>achusetts. He then applies to the Court for leave to <span class='line-break'> </span>sell the estate, which leave being granted, he can<span class='line-break'> </span>convey the lot by a deed that will be valid and<span class='line-break'> </span>forever bind their heirs. Unless this course is pu<span class='line-break'></span>sued, it will not be easy to find a purchaser.</p>

<p>As lots in Mt Auburn are<span class='line-break'> </span>declared by the Charter to be <ins>real estate</ins>,<span class='line-break'> </span>this lot by operation of law falls to<span class='line-break'> </span>you.- The Trustees some years since<span class='line-break'> </span>passed a by law, that any person<span class='line-break'> </span>claiming to be the sole heir of a deceased<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietor, may put presumptive ev<span class='line-break'></span>idence of his title to said lot on our<span class='line-break'> </span>records by filing an <ins>affidavit</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>of such claim.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I enclosed the Supt<sup>d</sup>  Rep<sup>t</sup> <span class='line-break'> </span>of present condition of lot no 1175, also<span class='line-break'> </span>of <a href='/pages/subjects/64120' title='Lot 1875'>lots 1875</a> to <a href='/pages/subjects/64121' title='Lot 1878'><!--Lot-->1878</a> inclusive for which<span class='line-break'> </span>latter a contract is sought to be <span class='line-break'> </span>made including all the lots in one<span class='line-break'> </span>sum.</p>
<p>You perceive <a href='/pages/subjects/55278' title='Winsor, Daniel L., Capt.'>Capt. Winsor's</a> sug<span class='line-break'></span>gestion of 700 or 750 for the whole.-</p>
<p>The by-law (p. 48 of Catalogue sc.) now stands<span class='line-break'> </span>thus - "The Trustees may also <ins>guarantee</ins> the perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>repair of lots containing 300 feet &amp; upwards, on pay<span class='line-break'></span>ment to the Treas<sup>r</sup> of a sum not less than $300,<span class='line-break'> </span>and of lots containing less than 300 feet on the pay<span class='line-break'></span>ment of a sum not less than $100."</p>
<p>Each of these four lots contains 300 feet.-<span class='line-break'> </span>hence the by-law would require $1200.-</p>
<p>For lots contiguous and in one enclosure,<span class='line-break'> </span>I am compelled to think the by-law is impracti<span class='line-break'></span>cable. As it stood at first, $300 was the least<span class='line-break'> </span>sum which could be accepted for the guaranty<span class='line-break'> </span>upon <ins>any</ins> lot. Then came applications<span class='line-break'> </span>for the perpetual care of small lots,<span class='line-break'> </span>lots on which very small expense would<span class='line-break'> </span>be required; and an amendment was<span class='line-break'> </span>tasked on <date when='1859-10-03'>Oct. 3. 1859</date>, providing that for<span class='line-break'> </span>lots of ^<sup>not</sup> less than 100 feet a sum not less<span class='line-break'> </span>than $100 should be required.</p>
<p>And now comes another case, where<span class='line-break'> </span>it is obvious that two, three, or more<span class='line-break'> </span>contiguous lots improved in the same<span class='line-break'> </span>manner, and at the same time, can<span class='line-break'> </span>be taken for a much less sum than<span class='line-break'> </span>if situated in different parts of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery.</p>
<p>The truth is that the number of square<span class='line-break'> </span>feet in a given lot, or enclosure containing<span class='line-break'> </span>two or more lots, is a very poor standard<span class='line-break'> </span>for fixing the requisite amount, because<span class='line-break'> </span>it may cost more to take care of one<span class='line-break'> </span>lot with 100 feet with its appurtenances,<span class='line-break'> </span>than another lot with 200 or 300 feet.<span class='line-break'> </span>Besides, the statement of a sum in<span class='line-break'> </span>the catalogue operates to mislead per<span class='line-break'></span>sons who do not read carefully. They<span class='line-break'> </span>come with $300 fixed in mind, and<span class='line-break'> </span>when $500 or $600 is asked, they appear<span class='line-break'> </span>to be greatly surprised and disappointed.</p>

<p>If you will suffer the suggestion,<span class='line-break'> </span>I think the 2<sup>d</sup> clause of Art. 29 of the by<span class='line-break'></span>laws - p. 48 ^<sup>to the end of the first sentence,</sup> should be amended to read -</p>

<p>As the least sum that can be received<span class='line-break'> </span>at all is $100, there would seem to be no<span class='line-break'> </span>danger in leaving this clause without the<span class='line-break'> </span>minimum limit of $100, as the Comm<sup>ee</sup>  on Lots<span class='line-break'> </span>would not be very likely to <ins>guarantee</ins> per<span class='line-break'></span>petual care for a smaller sum than they are<span class='line-break'> </span>at liberty to accept at any rate, viz $100.</p>

<p>Now <a href='/pages/subjects/64152' title='lot 2770'>lot 2770</a> belongs to <a href='/pages/subjects/64153' title='Burt, William Lathrop'>Mr Burt</a><span class='line-break'> </span>and the undertaker tells me that the<span class='line-break'> </span>interment was made in what he under<span class='line-break'></span>stands to be <a href='/pages/subjects/64153' title='Burt, William Lathrop'>Mr Burt's</a> lot.-</p>
<p>One of two things is then obvious - that<span class='line-break'> </span>either the interment was wrong, or the<span class='line-break'> </span>order for it should be corrected.</p>
<p>Will one of you see me - almost any<span class='line-break'> </span>day after 12 noon.</p>

<p><a href='/pages/subjects/64154' title='Hallet, Henry S.'>Henry S. Hallet</a> Esq<sup>r</sup></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A gentleman called<span class='line-break'> </span>here yesterday to inquire about the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>for sale, in <a href='/pages/subjects/59983' title='Hazel Dell'>Hazel Dell</a>, owned by our Corpor<span class='line-break'></span>ation, and recollecting your sale on<span class='line-break'> </span>Monday, I at once said, "I suppose<span class='line-break'> </span>you are connected with the gentleman<span class='line-break'> </span>who called Monday in making this<span class='line-break'> </span>inquiry." He said "No, he had inquired<span class='line-break'> </span>of me previously about this tomb &amp; <span class='line-break'> </span>other locations" - which fact I had<span class='line-break'> </span>forgotten. He wishes the refusal of <span class='line-break'> </span>the tomb at our price - $2,000 - for 24<span class='line-break'> </span>hours. I told him, I could not <span class='line-break'> </span>do anything without seeing <a href='/pages/subjects/55278' title='Winsor, Daniel L., Capt.'>Capt.<span class='line-break'> </span>Winsor</a>, which I would do this<span class='line-break'> </span>morning, and answer him today <span class='line-break'> </span>at 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the Sup<sup>t</sup> this<span class='line-break'> </span>morning, I learned that you<span class='line-break'> </span>had proposed to bring your friend<span class='line-break'> </span>out to see it, and wished the refusal<span class='line-break'> </span>of the tomb for three or four<span class='line-break'> </span>days, and that he had<span class='line-break'> </span>promised you that he would<span class='line-break'> </span>not dispose of it without giving<span class='line-break'> </span>you notice.</p>
<p>I therefore write you, to say<span class='line-break'> </span>that we shall be compelled to <span class='line-break'> </span>ask you to decide in the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>today or tomorrow as another<span class='line-break'> </span>gentleman stands ready (I think)<span class='line-break'> </span>to take it, and only asked for<span class='line-break'> </span>today.</p>
<p>This is not intended to hasten<span class='line-break'> </span>you, on a false alarm - but as<span class='line-break'> </span>we have another <ins>bona-fide</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>bidder, we must look after the<span class='line-break'> </span>interests of the Corporation in this<span class='line-break'> </span>matter.</p>

<p>In looking over our<span class='line-break'> </span>papers &amp; records, I find that no<span class='line-break'> </span>transfer back to the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>was made of <a href='/pages/subjects/60668' title='Lot 473'>lot 473</a> in Mount<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn, as contemplated in<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/64019' title='Putnam, Catherine'>Miss Putnam's</a> will.

<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I have been unusually busy this week,<span class='line-break'> </span>and although I took the minutes of the <span class='line-break'> </span>monument Monday to send you, have<span class='line-break'> </span>been presented from doing so until now.</p>
<p>I have had the monument removed<span class='line-break'> </span>to <a href='/pages/subjects/64030' title='McDonald, Alexander'>Alex<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup> Donald's</a> marble works<span class='line-break'> </span>for cleanings.-</p>
<p>The free stone plinth resting upon the <span class='line-break'> </span>underground foundation is 27 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>square - or 2ft. 3 inches; and that or <span class='line-break'> </span>an inch or two more - say 28 or 29 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>should be the size of the foundation.<span class='line-break'> </span>To secure the monument against heaving by <span class='line-break'> </span>frost, the foundation should be three feet<span class='line-break'> </span>deep of cobble stones, beneath, with flat <span class='line-break'> </span>stones on top secured with mortar<span class='line-break'> </span>and made perfectly level. A mason<span class='line-break'> </span>who understands his trade, will<span class='line-break'> </span>know how to do this, or any decent<span class='line-break'> </span>mechanic.</p>
<p>As to the weight of the monument<span class='line-break'> </span>and plinth, <a href='/pages/subjects/64030' title='McDonald, Alexander'>Mr M<sup>c</sup>Donald</a> estimated<span class='line-break'> </span>to be about 1800 or 1900 - call it<span class='line-break'> </span>one ton. A team of two horses would<span class='line-break'> </span>draw it quite easily. One horse<span class='line-break'> </span>could do it, if the road is not<span class='line-break'> </span>much uphill, and muddy.<span class='line-break'> </span>Perhaps you can arrange with<span class='line-break'> </span>some one who comes down to<span class='line-break'> </span>market, to take it in on his<span class='line-break'> </span>return. He should have two<span class='line-break'> </span>or three cloths or bark mats<span class='line-break'> </span>to keep it from chafing.</p>
<p>I will have the remains, also<span class='line-break'> </span>at <a href='/pages/subjects/64030' title='McDonald, Alexander'>Mr M<sup>c</sup>Donald's</a>.</p>
<p>If you can give me the number<span class='line-break'> </span>of your <del>monument</del> lot in the <span class='line-break'> </span>new Cemetery - if you have<span class='line-break'> </span>numbers there, <a href='/pages/subjects/64030' title='McDonald, Alexander'>Mr M<sup>c</sup>Donald</a><span class='line-break'> </span>will cut it on the plinth,<span class='line-break'> </span>where now 895 in. He will<span class='line-break'> </span>remove the 895 by cutting out<span class='line-break'> </span>a little pannel, which will<span class='line-break'> </span>not disfigure it. I will let<span class='line-break'> </span>it remain however until you reply.</p>
<p>Please sign these papers - orders for<span class='line-break'> </span>removal, and return them to me; and <span class='line-break'> </span>say whether you wish a member cat. &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>what. I will notify you when all is ready.</p>

<p>Dear Madam, Yours<span class='line-break'> </span>of <date when='1863-11-18'>18<sup>th</sup></date> has come to hand. I<span class='line-break'> </span>was at Mt Auburn this morning,<span class='line-break'> </span>and noticed that the <ins>number</ins> of your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot is cut upon the marble monument.<span class='line-break'> </span>So that you will need only the four<span class='line-break'> </span>8 inch boundary posts. I write this<span class='line-break'> </span>morning, lest you should be under<span class='line-break'> </span>a misapprehension as to the expense<span class='line-break'> </span>that may be incurred by a compliance<span class='line-break'> </span>with our rule. The whole cost to you<span class='line-break'> </span>of these four posts set will be but<span class='line-break'> </span>eight dollars $8.:- and we do not<span class='line-break'> </span>propose to put you to any other expense<span class='line-break'> </span>than what you may voluntarily incur.</p>
<p>If you wish the amount to remain until<span class='line-break'> </span>Spring, just say so,-  we can set the posts<span class='line-break'> </span>and let the bill wait that long, if any<span class='line-break'> </span>particular accommodation.</p>
<p>The cost of cut the grass through the season<span class='line-break'> </span>is usually $3. or $5 if some plants are set in<span class='line-break'> </span>the border. - The Corporation cuts the grass on<span class='line-break'> </span>all lots not cared for at the expense of the prop<sup>rs</sup>,<span class='line-break'> </span>about twice a year <ins>without</ins> charge, but<span class='line-break'> </span>this is not often enough to keep lots green.<span class='line-break'> </span>About once in ten years a lot wants new sodding,<span class='line-break'> </span>cost about $15 to $20, for manure, sod &amp; work.</p>
<p>We have had your name in our records &amp; on our last catalogue <a href='/pages/subjects/65125' title='Bliss, Eliza A.'><ins>Eliza </ins> A. Bliss</a>. A few days<span class='line-break'> </span>since a clerk of our [Mission?] told me it was <ins>Elizabeth</ins>. I don't know how this mistake came<span class='line-break'> </span>to be made. I see that you signed the affidavit which I prepared two or three years since<span class='line-break'> </span>without correcting it.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Yours of 13<sup>th</sup> last<span class='line-break'> </span>was rec<sup>d</sup>. The expense of setting four<span class='line-break'> </span>8 inch posts on your lot will be<span class='line-break'> </span>($8.00) eight dollars and whatever<span class='line-break'> </span>additional cost may be incurred by<span class='line-break'> </span>us for cutting No. 76 on a granite front<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole will not exceed $10: <ins>probably</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>not more than $9.00.</p>
<p>You say you "should prefer<span class='line-break'> </span>to sell the lot." I think that can<span class='line-break'> </span>be effected, if you will say what<span class='line-break'> </span>you are willing to sell it for.</p>
<p>All we ask for land around that<span class='line-break'> </span>point is 50 cents per foot = $150 for<span class='line-break'> </span>a lot of 300 feet, which is the<span class='line-break'> </span>size of 76. - It is rather late this<span class='line-break'> </span>autumn, but still I might dispose<span class='line-break'> </span>of it before winter.</p>
<p>If you choose, you can<span class='line-break'> </span>[use?] either course - say<span class='line-break'> </span>what you will take for it now<span class='line-break'> </span>in cash - or at any time <ins>within<span class='line-break'> </span>6 mos.</ins> as soon as a sale can<span class='line-break'> </span>be effected, giving me the privilege<span class='line-break'> </span>of grading it and putting it in<span class='line-break'> </span>a saleable condition. I should<span class='line-break'> </span>prefer the latter mode. You will<span class='line-break'> </span>be safe under it, as the land<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot run away - cannot deterior<span class='line-break'></span>ate in value, and cannot be<span class='line-break'> </span>conveyed away from you.</p>
<p>I shall be pleased to<span class='line-break'> </span>hear from you on the<span class='line-break'> </span>subject.</p>
<p>In this way two things will be<span class='line-break'> </span>secured - you will dispose of what<span class='line-break'> </span>you do not wish for, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>appearance of the grounds will be<span class='line-break'> </span>improved.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Yours of 14<sup>th</sup> [last?] came <span class='line-break'> </span>duly to hand with draft for $10. for which I send<span class='line-break'> </span>you the enclosed receipted bill. The frost is now  &amp; has<span class='line-break'> </span>been since the receipt of your note quite deep &amp; the<span class='line-break'> </span>work will be done as soon as frost permits.</p>
<p>From the mound, I had always supposed you<span class='line-break'> </span>had a tomb, &amp; was quite surprised to learn from<span class='line-break'> </span>you that such is not the case. The tomb privilege<span class='line-break'> </span>there however is worth nothing, because the ground<span class='line-break'> </span>is so low, it would be wet, &amp; no one would be wil<span class='line-break'></span>ling to sink one there. We have abundance of side<span class='line-break'> </span>hill better adapted to the purpose. The price of lots<span class='line-break'> </span>there - the current rate - is 50 cts per foot. That is<span class='line-break'> </span>what our last sale was made at; making your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot worth $150, or with the posts &amp;c. $160. The<span class='line-break'> </span>mound would not be available in new<span class='line-break'> </span>grading, as the whole lot will need<span class='line-break'> </span>raising three or four feet.</p>
<p>What cost you $60 on the <date when='1881-11-18'>18<sup>th</sup> day of Nov<sup>r</sup> <span class='line-break'> </span>1881</date> is now worth $150. You have had a<span class='line-break'> </span>venerable length of possession, viz. 32 years<span class='line-break'> </span>and with 192 per ct added for interest, you<span class='line-break'> </span>should be entitled to $115.20 + 60 = $175.20.<span class='line-break'> </span>But, although the prices have advanced enough<span class='line-break'> </span>to cover interest, in some cases, they will<span class='line-break'> </span>not in the case of the older proprietors: and<span class='line-break'> </span>rarely has it been the case that an old lot<span class='line-break'> </span>would bring a sum equal to interests added,<span class='line-break'> </span>because there are so many new ones equally<span class='line-break'> </span>eligible. Generally, however, where a proprietor<span class='line-break'> </span>wishes to sell out, he has had some use of his<span class='line-break'> </span>lot, which is deemed an offset to the failure to<span class='line-break'> </span>receive interest.</p>
<p>If you wish to authorize me to sell<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot for the sum named - $160 - I will do the<span class='line-break'> </span>best I can to dispose of it: and can probably<span class='line-break'> </span>do so in the Spring, if not earlier.</p>

In this case, if<span class='line-break'> </span>the Repair Fund should ever be lost, the whole<span class='line-break'> </span>property of the Corporation is held for the per--<span class='line-break'> </span>petual repair of such lots."—</p>
<p>Upon the supposition that you under--<span class='line-break'> </span>stood the above clauses, which I either<span class='line-break'> </span>showed or explained to you, when you wrote<span class='line-break'> </span>on <date when='1864-02-27'>27<sup>th</sup> Feby.</date> asking— "what will be the<span class='line-break'> </span>amount to be paid to secure <ins>perpetual</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>care of my <a href='/pages/subjects/65941' title='Lot 2151'>lot no. 2151</a>"?— I very nat--<span class='line-break'> </span>urally supposed you desired the <ins>guaranty</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>contract. With that supposition, I sub<span class='line-break'></span>mitted that question to the Committee on<span class='line-break'> </span>Lots. Your lot contains 300 square feet<span class='line-break'> </span>as shown by the catalogue, and by the<span class='line-break'> </span>[Corporation?] [last sentence on page hard to read]</p>
<p>the only place proper for reference to obtain<span class='line-break'> </span>certain knowledge on that point. I have<span class='line-break'> </span>the usual examination made by the Super--<span class='line-break'> </span>intendent in back cases reported in writing<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Com<sup>ee</sup>, which paper is returned to me<span class='line-break'> </span>and placed on the files. In that paper is --<span class='line-break'> </span>"size of lot -- 300 square feet."— Your<span class='line-break'> </span>suggestion, therefore, that "the Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>must have made a mistake in the size of my<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/65941' title='Lot 2151'>lot 2151</a>"— is, I must think, somewhat out<span class='line-break'> </span>of place.</p>
<p>You have evidently confounded the two<span class='line-break'> </span>kinds of contract. If you notice the lan--<span class='line-break'> </span>guage of the by-law again you will see that<span class='line-break'> </span>there is no absolute measure for the care of<span class='line-break'> </span>a lot. No sum <ins>less</ins> than $100 can be received.<span class='line-break'> </span>You can pay in $100, if you choose, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation will faithfully apply the income,<span class='line-break'> </span>to the purpose— but if it is insufficient for<span class='line-break'> </span>all that may be required, no one can<span class='line-break'> </span>certainly find fault for the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>not going beyond the means at their disposal.<span class='line-break'> </span>It is a <ins>trust</ins>.

<p>agents, and have no right to involve the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation in obligations which are attended<span class='line-break'> </span>only with lots.</p>
<p>For the <ins>guaranty</ins> contract the Trustees decide<span class='line-break'> </span>in each case the amount according to the value<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot &amp; its appurtenances. I notifed another<span class='line-break'> </span>gentleman on the same day that I did you. The<span class='line-break'> </span>amount in his case was $800. Your lot, if<span class='line-break'> </span>there was no monument or fence, could not be<span class='line-break'> </span>taken for less than $300. The measure of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporate obligation is for <ins>all time</ins>,<span class='line-break'> </span>and independently of any <ins>depreciation of money</ins>,<span class='line-break'> </span>and to the extent of the <ins>value of everything upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot</ins>. If the monument is struck by lightning<span class='line-break'> </span>or broken by a tornado, or the fall of a tree, or<span class='line-break'> </span>by malicious mischief or from any other cause,<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation is liable to replace it. --</p>
<p>I think now you will perceive the dif<span class='line-break'></span>ference between the two clauses. -- To give<span class='line-break'> </span>one, two or three hundred, as you please, is<span class='line-break'> </span>practically safe, and under it you get the<span class='line-break'> </span>full benefit; but many prefer the guaranty<span class='line-break'> </span>there whatever expense is required is borne by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation.</p>
<p>The amount necessary for the annual care is<span class='line-break'> </span>a poor criterion. Every few years extra repair, as<span class='line-break'> </span>new grading, sodding, i.e, are needed, and these<span class='line-break'> </span>have been but little, if any, accumulation, under<span class='line-break'> </span>any of the contracts.</p>
<p>I am very happy to explain, &amp; only re--<span class='line-break'> </span>gret that you should be been misled in<span class='line-break'> </span>your information.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your explanations for<span class='line-break'> </span>my inquiries about certain lots were rec<sup>d</sup>.<span class='line-break'> </span>I fear there is still some error -- for if you<span class='line-break'> </span>give <a href='/pages/subjects/65991' title='Lot 3423'>3423</a> to <a href='/pages/subjects/65992' title='Phelps, Agnes R.'>Agnes R.

<p>As there is always great liability to<span class='line-break'> </span>troublesome errors in reporting and making<span class='line-break'> </span>changed, and as several have occurred much <span class='line-break'> </span>to the disfigurement of the record, I beg<span class='line-break'> </span>leave to say that I prefer, if you have<span class='line-break'> </span>no objection, to seek explanation of difficult<span class='line-break'> </span>matters in your department, directly of you,<span class='line-break'> </span>instead of "asking <a href='/pages/subjects/79942' title='Safford, Frederick Marcy'>Fred</a>", as mature heads<span class='line-break'> </span>are required to bear the responsibility.</p>
<p>Please observe the accompanying order<span class='line-break'> </span>for <a href='/pages/subjects/65997' title='Marsh, Mr.'>Mr Marsh</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have just rec<sup>d</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>the reply of the Committee on Lots<span class='line-break'> </span>in answer to the inquiry for what<span class='line-break'> </span>sum the Corporation will assume<span class='line-break'> </span>the Perpetual Care of <a href='/pages/subjects/65988' title='Lot 3324'>Lot no. 3324</a>.</p>
<p>The amount they name is<span class='line-break'> </span>six hundred and fifty dollars ($650) --<span class='line-break'> </span>which is less than I expected.</p>
<p>If you will call in the <ins>after<span class='line-break'></span>noon</ins> of almost any day, it will<span class='line-break'> </span>be a little better time for you, as<span class='line-break'> </span>we shall be less likely to be inter<span class='line-break'></span>rupted by calls. --</p>

<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>The <a href='/pages/subjects/66046' title='Hallet, Esther'>widow<!--Esther Hallet--></a> of the late <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Ezekiel<span class='line-break'> </span>Hallet Jr</a>, husband of your daughter the ^<sup>late</sup> proprietor of <a href='/pages/subjects/66042' title='Lot 2603'>lot 2603</a> in<span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn, has just called at my office, supposing that<span class='line-break'> </span>she had an interest in said lot by reason of her husband and<span class='line-break'> </span>child's decease, and wished to make her interest appear by deed. I<span class='line-break'> </span>at once remembered the transfer to you, and went to my record,<span class='line-break'> </span>and showed her the evidence of the transfer to you. She was greatly<span class='line-break'> </span>surprised -- had never heard anything about the transfer --<span class='line-break'> </span>supposed that the lot, upon the decease of <a href='/pages/subjects/66043' title='Hallet, Elizabeth D.'>Mrs Elizabeth D. Hallet</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>went to her husband, and she is therefore apparently in some<span class='line-break'> </span>trouble of mind for what has occurred, which adds to her<span class='line-break'> </span>affliction. She recently came from her father's in Vermont, with<span class='line-break'> </span>her child and went to the Cape to visit your and his relations.<span class='line-break'> </span>While there her child died. As she was confined just before<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Hallet's death, he asked her, in case the child should<span class='line-break'> </span>not live, that it might be laid in the same grave with<span class='line-break'> </span>himself. She therefore went to Mt Auburn last Saturday,<span class='line-break'> </span>with the body of the child. She says she knew nothing of the<span class='line-break'> </span>transfer to you, and asked to have the grave opened. Our<span class='line-break'> </span>employees at the gate knew nothing of the transfer to you,<span class='line-break'> </span>as we have not published a new catalogue for four<span class='line-break'> </span>years, and naturally presuming from the facts stated to<span class='line-break'> </span>them, of the burial of her husband in the lot, they obeyed<span class='line-break'> </span>her order to open a grave -- and by her wish in the</p>

<p>matter was accomplished, her child was buried with<span class='line-break'> </span>the father. Today, in the same ignorance of facts, she<span class='line-break'> </span>went to a marble worker and engaged a ^<sup>marble</sup> tablet to<span class='line-break'> </span>erect over the grave, to the memory of the father and<span class='line-break'> </span>child, but had not given him the inscription, and was <span class='line-break'> </span>to go again to him. Meanwhile she called upon me, and<span class='line-break'> </span>learned, to her surprize, of the transfer to you, and stated<span class='line-break'> </span>all the circumstances. She has, innocently and ignorant<span class='line-break'> </span>of the <ins>legal</ins> facts, buried her child without your order.<span class='line-break'> </span>I told her it would be best to acquaint you with the<span class='line-break'> </span>facts and circumstances and obtain your consent, and<span class='line-break'> </span>she [then?], desired me to write you.</p>
<p>She expects to leave for Vermont <ins>next Tuesday noon</ins>:<span class='line-break'> </span>and I shall, therefore, feel obliged if you will reply at<span class='line-break'> </span>once, and state what you are willing should be done,<span class='line-break'> </span>so that I can receive your letter as early as Monday morning.</p>
<p>As I understand the matter -- there are now three graves<span class='line-break'> </span>in the lot -- one occupied by <a href='/pages/subjects/66045' title='Green, William E.'>your late husband<!--Green--></a>, Mr Collins,<span class='line-break'> </span>one by <a href='/pages/subjects/66043' title='Hallet, Elizabeth D.'>Mrs <!--Elizabeth D.-->Hallet</a> -- one by <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a> and this child. There<span class='line-break'> </span>are also, I learn, some bones or remains <del>[few?]</del> of a brother<span class='line-break'> </span>of Mr Collins, <a href='/pages/subjects/66046' title='Hallet, Esther'>Mrs<!--Hallet--></a>, or Mr Hallet, (I did not notice which,)<span class='line-break'> </span>in one of the graves. This leaves space for two<span class='line-break'> </span>graves, and, I am told, if the interments had<span class='line-break'> </span>been properly made, there would be three graves.</p>
<p>I do not remember what ^<sup>spaces</sup> you wished to be reserved<span class='line-break'> </span>for grave or graves: but remember that you said your <span class='line-break'> </span>sons would never desire any resting place there.<span class='line-break'> </span>I don't remember whether you wished to reserve<span class='line-break'> </span>a place for yourself or anyone else, but have the im-</p>

<p>pression you wished only one grave. --</p>
<p>My view of the matter is this. The <ins>legal</ins> title is in you,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the legal right to say who <del>shall</del> ^<sup>may</sup> be interred there -<span class='line-break'></span>but I think there was an <ins>equitable</ins> right to place<span class='line-break'> </span>the child with the father -- especially if he requested it.<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/66046' title='Hallet, Esther'>Mrs H.<!--Hallet--></a> says that <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a> told her that the lot was<span class='line-break'> </span>taken in his wife's name, but that he actually<span class='line-break'> </span>paid for it. I do not find that any right has been<span class='line-break'> </span>taken from you, as the child was placed in the same grave<span class='line-break'> </span>with the father. We should, however, have preferred to do<span class='line-break'> </span>this on your order: and our agents at the Cemetery would<span class='line-break'> </span>have so required, if they had promised the means of<span class='line-break'> </span>knowing the lot to be yours. It still stood, with them, in <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a>'s<span class='line-break'> </span>name, and this lady told them ^<sup>that</sup> Mrs &amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a> were both<span class='line-break'> </span>dead, and she supposed she had the right to order the inter<span class='line-break'></span>ment.</p>
<p>I have taken so much pains to give you the facts that you<span class='line-break'> </span>may see that blame appears to attach to no one.</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/66046' title='Hallet, Esther'>Mrs Hallet</a> says she does not wish to wrong you or anyone<span class='line-break'> </span>else in the matter. She loved dearly this little child of 20 months,<span class='line-break'> </span>and would like the privilege of being laid beside it and her hus<span class='line-break'></span>band: but if you do not feel perfectly free to accord that<span class='line-break'> </span>to her, she should prefer to remove them both from the lot. -<span class='line-break'></span>She will stop the work on the marble tablet and pedestal until<span class='line-break'> </span>she hears from you.

Indeed, if he paid<span class='line-break'> </span>for the lot, I think it would be her <ins>moral</ins> right.

She was in <a href='/pages/subjects/52559' title='Boston, MA'>Boston</a> or<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/60012' title='Winchester, MA'>Winchester</a>, and consequently did not receive my letter.<span class='line-break'> </span>She came in as soon as her husband wrote her that<span class='line-break'> </span>my letter had been received.</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/66039' title='Green, Elizabeth T.'>Mrs Green</a>, although evidently having strong<span class='line-break'> </span>feeling in reference to matters alluded to by yourself,<span class='line-break'> </span>appeared to hear what I had to say with calmness,<span class='line-break'> </span>and came to her conclusions with deliberation.</p>
<p>She is perfectly willing that the remains of the child<span class='line-break'> </span>should lie in the <a href='/pages/subjects/66042' title='Lot 2603'>lot (2603)</a> or be removed from it, <span class='line-break'> </span>as you prefer.</p>
<p>She is unwilling -- and will never give her consent --<span class='line-break'> </span>to have the body of <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Ezekiel Hallet Jr.</a> removed from the lot.</p>
<p>Upon the 3<sup>d</sup> point, whether she would consent to your<span class='line-break'> </span>having a personal right there for yourself,  I do not think<span class='line-break'> </span>she is yet prepared to give you any pledge for it, or<span class='line-break'> </span>to absolutely deny you that right.</p>
<p>She says she does not wish to carry animosities<span class='line-break'> </span>beyond the grave, and, so far as she personally is<span class='line-break'> </span>concerned, it would make no difference:  but she<span class='line-break'> </span>thinks there are others who would object, at least<span class='line-break'> </span>as matters now stand.  She cannot tell what she</p>

<p>166</p>
<p>might do, if she were to survive you, which is<span class='line-break'> </span>hardly probable in the ordinary course of events, but it<span class='line-break'> </span>is entirely possible.  My own impression is that if<span class='line-break'> </span>the question were to arise today, while you are the<span class='line-break'> </span>widow of <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a>, she would not refuse, and<span class='line-break'> </span>that perhaps might be the case twenty years hence if you<span class='line-break'> </span>still remained his widow, and the request was made<span class='line-break'> </span>in your behalf, there still being room in the lot.</p>
<p>But, the more I think of that point, the more<span class='line-break'> </span>I am convinced it is rather an impracticable ques-<span class='line-break'></span>tion for you.  You are yet young, and the chances<span class='line-break'> </span>are very strong that you will marry again. If<span class='line-break'> </span>that <ins>should</ins> be the case, it would, in my judge-<span class='line-break'></span>ment, put at rest all anxiety -- in your mind on that<span class='line-break'> </span>point; and your fortunes would be as likely to be cast elsewhere<span class='line-break'> </span>as in this vicinity.  Indeed, if you should remain un-<span class='line-break'></span>married for some time, I think it more than probable that<span class='line-break'> </span>your wishes would change on this point.  I regard you,<span class='line-break'> </span>at present, unfitted to settle so uncertain a point as this<span class='line-break'> </span>for all time.</p>
<p>I have looked at the plan of the grounds about this lot and<span class='line-break'> </span>there is no more land that can be added to the lot.</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/66039' title='Green, Elizabeth T.'>Mrs Green</a> tells me that <a href='/pages/subjects/66041' title='Hallet, Ezekiel, Jr.'>Mr Hallet</a> <ins>never did</ins> pay for the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot -- that <a href='/pages/subjects/66043' title='Hallet, Elizabeth D.'>Mrs Hallet</a> and herself paid for it, and it belongs to her<span class='line-break'> </span>no less from purchase than as heir.--</p>
<p>The result then is -- if you are willing <a href='/pages/subjects/66039' title='Green, Elizabeth T.'>Mrs Green</a> is also<span class='line-break'> </span>willing to let things remain where they are now.  She is unwilling that<span class='line-break'> </span>any more interments should be made there without her order.  She<span class='line-break'> </span>will probably remain here all this week.  If you have anything further you <span class='line-break'> </span>wish to say, &amp; will write me at once, I will confer further with her before her leaving.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your deed had<span class='line-break'> </span>not come to me when I saw you the other<span class='line-break'> </span>day. Since then it was handed in for record<span class='line-break'> </span>together with a very scaly looking deed from<span class='line-break'> </span>Garder to <a href='/pages/subjects/66057' title='Hood, Mrs.'>Mrs Hood</a>. -- As you executed<span class='line-break'> </span>it as the Ex<sup>or</sup>of <a href='/pages/subjects/66058' title='Parkman, Mary George'>Mrs Parkman</a>, I feared<span class='line-break'> </span>you had made an error therein and went to<span class='line-break'> </span>the Probate office here to see if I could trace<span class='line-break'> </span>the title. Not finding it, &amp; remembering being<span class='line-break'> </span>once shown a place in <a href='/pages/subjects/60948' title='Brighton, MA'>Brighton</a>, when I was<span class='line-break'> </span>a little boy, as that of <a href='/pages/subjects/66059' title='Parkman, David'>David Parkman</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>I thought I would refer to the records<span class='line-break'> </span>in Middlesex county:  and there found a<span class='line-break'> </span>will of <a href='/pages/subjects/66059' title='Parkman, David'>David Parkman</a>, <ins>of <a href='/pages/subjects/53203' title='Cambridge, MA'>Cambridge</a></ins>, in which<span class='line-break'> </span>all his personal estate was given absolutely to his<span class='line-break'> </span>widow, <a href='/pages/subjects/66058' title='Parkman, Mary George'>Mary George Parkman</a>, and "all real<span class='line-break'> </span>^ <sup>&amp; personal</sup> estate in reversion or expectancy, to my wife <a href='/pages/subjects/66058' title='Parkman, Mary George'>Mary G.<!--Parkman--></a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>to be held and endorsed by her during her natural<span class='line-break'> </span>life, and after her decease to be divided equally<span class='line-break'> </span>between my two youngest children, <a href='/pages/subjects/66060' title='Parkman, Charles M.'>Charles M.<!--Parkman--></a><span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/66061' title='Parkman, Mary H.'>Mary H.

If<span class='line-break'> </span>the second clause above quoted "real estate<span class='line-break'> </span>in reversion or expectancy" does not cover it --<span class='line-break'> </span>by which it went to your wife &amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/66060' title='Parkman, Charles M.'>Mr Chas.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I regretted to hear <span class='line-break'> </span>yesterday from <a href='/pages/subjects/54774' title='Little, Charles C.'>C.C.

<p>I do not learn that you ever<span class='line-break'> </span>called upon or inquired of me whether<span class='line-break'> </span>I had done my duty in the matter, but<span class='line-break'> </span>by some means had come to the<span class='line-break'> </span>conclusion that I had omitted<span class='line-break'> </span>to do it. I must therefore infer that<span class='line-break'> </span>you arrived at this conclusion<span class='line-break'> </span>by forgetting the date when<span class='line-break'> </span>you made your affidavit<span class='line-break'> </span>and examining some edition of<span class='line-break'> </span>the catalogue antedating your<span class='line-break'> </span>affidavit.</p>
<p>The facts I find from record<span class='line-break'> </span>are -</p>

<p>The previous edition, if you<span class='line-break'> </span>will examine, was printed as early<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>May 1, 1857,</ins> and was distributed<span class='line-break'> </span>among the proprietors in June of that<span class='line-break'> </span>year, at least a month before your affidavit.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I wish you would<span class='line-break'> </span>endeavor to report upon <a href='/pages/subjects/67066' title='lot 525'>lot 525</a> <a href='/pages/subjects/59901' title='Olive Path'>Olive Path</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>to <a href='/pages/subjects/67065' title='Farwell, Oliver A.'>Oliver A. Farwell</a>, if you can. I am inclined to,<span class='line-break'> </span>think, from <a href='/pages/subjects/81482' title='Shedd, J. H., Mr.'>Mr Shedd's</a> statement, that his surveyor's<span class='line-break'> </span>measurement is correct - for he states that although<span class='line-break'> </span>he gives one of the distances on the sketch handed you,<span class='line-break'> </span>as 13ft., that was a mere error of figures there,<span class='line-break'> </span>and that he calculated the area by calling that distance<span class='line-break'> </span>15 feet. It seems a pity, when the money has been ready<span class='line-break'> </span>for the lot so long, that the proprietor should not receive<span class='line-break'> </span>his deeds. I have the impression the figures he<span class='line-break'> </span>gave me were 356 ft. but your memo will<span class='line-break'> </span>show. My former note contained it as he<span class='line-break'> </span>gave it to me.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your note of yesterday with accompanying<span class='line-break'> </span>papers was rec<sup>d</sup> today between 1 and 2 o'clock, so that<span class='line-break'> </span>it would be impossible for me to redraft the paper on<span class='line-break'> </span>the Repair Fund in the manner suggested by you in season<span class='line-break'> </span>for the next meeting of the Trustees - on Monday morning.<span class='line-break'> </span>Indeed when I saw you two days since, I understood<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; thought it was agreed, that, such were your and my<span class='line-break'> </span>engagements, the matter should stand for some time longer.</p>
<p>However, if I quote the vote of the Trustees on this, you<span class='line-break'> </span>will see that it need not be brought before the Board<span class='line-break'> </span>again.</p>
<p>"Voted that the Secretary, under the direction of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Committee on Lots, be authorized to send a printed circular<span class='line-break'> </span>to every proprietor of a lot in the Cemetery, in accordance<span class='line-break'> </span>with the previous vote."</p>
<p>The previous vote referred to was the acceptance of<span class='line-break'> </span>the report of your Com. through <a href='/pages/subjects/56312' title='Norcross, Otis'>Mr Norcross</a>, recommending<span class='line-break'> </span>that the Proprietors ^<sup>should</sup> be made acquainted with the subject<span class='line-break'> </span>by sending a printed notice.</p>
<p>The power, therefore, over the whole matter is<span class='line-break'> </span>rested with your Com.<sup>ee</sup>.  The vote does not<span class='line-break'> </span>limit the Com. as to the cost. Nor does it conflict<span class='line-break'> </span>with the by-law limiting a Com. to $100 in any ex-</p>

<p>Then as the question of expense is one ^<sup>alone</sup> for you and<span class='line-break'> </span>your Colleague, I suggest that you have probably an<span class='line-break'> </span>overestimate of what it is necessary to cost to print the<span class='line-break'> </span>paper as last suggested by me: although in my judg<span class='line-break'></span>ment, the highest figures shown you would be a wise<span class='line-break'> </span>investment for the Corporation, and would be returned<span class='line-break'> </span>an hundred fold. --</p>

<p>of work, which, to say nothing of its inartistic<span class='line-break'> </span>appearance, would have the sting extracted. --</p>
<p>The paper made up of the sentences marked by<span class='line-break'> </span>you would be only a bald statement of facts<span class='line-break'> </span>unsupported by reasons. It <del>says</del> ^<sup>is</sup> to the proprietor <span class='line-break'> </span>the <ins>ipse dixit</ins> of the writer, requiring him to<span class='line-break'> </span>believe it and act upon it, if moved<span class='line-break'> </span>by anything outside to do so, but he fails to<span class='line-break'> </span>find the reason in the paper itself. --</p>
<p>The great object I have endeavored to<span class='line-break'> </span>keep in view throughout, is that men are moved<span class='line-break'> </span>by <ins>argument</ins>, by <ins>inducement</ins>. I have supplied<span class='line-break'> </span>this partly by illustration -- partly by picture of what<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt Auburn will become if neglected, and their own<span class='line-break'> </span>lots in particular: partly by statement of plain facts, very<span class='line-break'> </span>necessary to be known by them. I wish proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>to be able to find <ins>somewhere</ins> a tolerably full statement of<span class='line-break'> </span>facts which they greatly need to know; and which they have <span class='line-break'> </span>hitherto looked in vain for, and to repeat which to<span class='line-break'> </span>them orally in each case is too great a labor for any<span class='line-break'> </span>trustee or officer.</p>
<p>I believe the facts contained in my paper, in their very<span class='line-break'> </span>style, are calculated to make those who read think more upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the subject, than if presented in a balder, and more formal style.<span class='line-break'> </span>If, however, anybody can put together a paper more satisfac<span class='line-break'></span>tory, I should hope the Com. would employ him to do so; for I<span class='line-break'> </span>am not ambitious in the matter. On the other hand, I am quite<span class='line-break'> </span>willing to submit the <ins>proofs</ins> to the Com. and if they see anything that does<span class='line-break'> </span>not read so well in type to amend.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>There is an error in casting<span class='line-break'> </span>the contents of <a href='/pages/subjects/67171' title='Lot 3499'>lot no. 3499</a>  on <a href='/pages/subjects/61169' title='Dianthus Path'>Dianthus Path</a>, that of<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/67202' title='Fines, Norris'>Norris Fines</a>, which I think you will, percieve on<span class='line-break'> </span>a moment's reflection,  [Image: diagram with measurments] You have given the<span class='line-break'> </span>contents as 123 feet, which figures can be obtained <span class='line-break'> </span>only be adding the opposite sides, and multiplying<span class='line-break'> </span>the halves together, ie, 14 x 9 &amp; one-half = 133.  But in a figure of [duel?]<span class='line-break'> </span>unequal sides, this makes a considerable error, as you see<span class='line-break'> </span>if you divide the lot into a rectangle and triangle, which gives<span class='line-break'> </span>you but 123 &amp; one-half feet, or 9 &amp; one-half less than you returned.-</p>
<p>This figure is a trapezoid, i.e, one with four sides<span class='line-break'> </span>only two of which are parallel.  The rule for finding the<span class='line-break'> </span>area of a trapezoid is:-</p>
<p>"Multiply half the sum of its parallel sides by the dis<span class='line-break'></span>tance between them:" - for it is equal to two triangles whose bases<span class='line-break'> </span>are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid, and whose altitude is the distance<span class='line-break'> </span>between them. To prove it in this case, - the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>[Image: Trapezoid diagram with figures.] <span class='line-break'> </span>A.B.C.D. is divided into the two triangles A.B.C and<span class='line-break'> </span>A.C.D - The base of A.B.C is A.B., it's altitude is B.C,<span class='line-break'> </span>The base of A.C.D. is A.D its altitude E.D.-<span class='line-break'> </span>A.B.C = 13 x 3 = 39. A.C.D = 13 x 6 &amp; one-half = 84 &amp; one-half total  123 &amp; one-half<span class='line-break'> </span>Or take A.B.C.E as a rectangle and the area is 13 x 6 = 78.<span class='line-break'> </span>Add triangle C.E.D = 13 x 3 &amp; one-half = 45 &amp; one-half - total 123 and one-half ft.<span class='line-break'> </span>But the bases of the triangles must always be the parallel sides of the traphezoid.</p>
<p>What will you do?  report say 124f and let the Treas<sup>r</sup> refund $9.?</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/53157' title='Coolidge, Austin J.'>A. J. Coolidge</a></p>
<p>The above rule is an excellent one.  In this case where the parallel sides are A.D. and B.C <span class='line-break'> </span>"half the distance betwen them" ( meaning of course the shortest distance) is either A.B or the dotted line E.C-</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Yourself and <a href='/pages/subjects/67208' title='Elliott, Charles D.'>Mr Chas.<span class='line-break'> </span>D. Elliott</a> of <a href='/pages/subjects/53203' title='Cambridge, MA'>Cambridge</a> purchased two lots in<span class='line-break'> </span>September on <a href='/pages/subjects/61288' title='Trefoil Path'>Trefoil Path</a>, and we are ignorant<span class='line-break'> </span>of your intentions as to how to divide the<span class='line-break'> </span>lots between you. I looked in a Cambridge Direc<span class='line-break'></span>tory for Mr Elliott and did not find his name.<span class='line-break'> </span>I live there myself, but do not know him. As there<span class='line-break'> </span>are four post offices in <a href='/pages/subjects/53203' title='Cambridge, MA'>Cambridge</a>, I prefer to address<span class='line-break'> </span>you my inquiry.</p>
<p>The sketch of the lots, as nearly as I can<span class='line-break'> </span>give it from the dimensions sent me is represented<span class='line-break'> </span>by the following figure: --</p>
<p>[diagram: measurements &amp; orientation]</p>
<p>It is fairly to be presumed that<span class='line-break'> </span>your division line will not run<span class='line-break'> </span>east and west, as that gives you two<span class='line-break'> </span>long and narrow lots. If it runs north and south,<span class='line-break'> </span>of course one takes the front and one the rear.</p>
<p>Will you please ^<sup>state</sup> if you divide by lines running north<span class='line-break'> </span>and south, which of you takes the east and which the west<span class='line-break'> </span>part: or how you divide in any case. --</p>
<p>Your speedy reply will oblige.</p>
<p>Yours Resp.y</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/67213' title='Collier, Mr.'>Mr Collier</a> has de<span class='line-break'></span>cided to take the deed of his other lot now, &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>he can transfer it to the person to whom you<span class='line-break'> </span>may sell. Will you therefore please report<span class='line-break'> </span>a number for it on Saturday.</p>
<p>Will you be kind enough to send and<span class='line-break'> </span>measure the diameter or chord of the front end<span class='line-break'> </span>of Hobbs' lot on <a href='/pages/subjects/61235' title='Mound Avenue'>Mound Ave<sup>e</sup></a>. You said it was<span class='line-break'> </span>twice the radius -- that makes but 4f 6 which<span class='line-break'> </span>makes a lot of this shape.</p>
<p>[diagram: measurements]</p>
<p>Now if the side come out nearly <span class='line-break'> </span>straight and make the front less tapering, the chord<span class='line-break'> </span>of that segment must be more than 4f 6 -- and if<span class='line-break'> </span>it tapers off as above, it is not an easy thing to measure<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot. I cannot make the deed well without know<span class='line-break'></span>ing the length of both this chord, and the distance from<span class='line-break'> </span>it round the front.</p>

<p><a href='/pages/subjects/54774' title='Little, Charles C.'>C.C. Little</a> Esq</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>When the question of compensa<span class='line-break'></span>tion came up last year, and gratuities were made<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Sup<sup>t</sup> and Gatekeeper, the Secretary made no<span class='line-break'> </span>request for increase of salary, but an increase<span class='line-break'> </span>was noted in the fees for making deeds, which resulted in<span class='line-break'> </span>increasing his compensation for the year about $48 or<span class='line-break'> </span>$50. As this increase of <ins>fees</ins> only related to the cost of making<span class='line-break'> </span>and recording deeds, and that is but a small part of the labor<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Secretary, it is manifest that no addition has been<span class='line-break'> </span>made to his pay (if addition were intended) commensurate with<span class='line-break'> </span>the increased cost of living, or as bearing any just relation to it.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of my time is spent in the service<span class='line-break'> </span>of the [?]. I receive $800 salary, and under the present rate<span class='line-break'> </span>of fees may [?] upon $200 for deeds  = $1000: out of which I<span class='line-break'> </span>have to pay for office rent, postage and fuel &amp;c., about $240 --<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] say $760. I think you will<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] the most of my time is spent in the service of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation, [?] compensation is hardly commensurate with the pay of<span class='line-break'> </span>other officers, according to the talents employed.</p>
<p>As the officers have been reelected, and as there is some<span class='line-break'> </span>doubt whether any further reorganization of offices will be attempted this<span class='line-break'> </span>year, you and <a href='/pages/subjects/65944' title='Sleeper, Jacob'>Mr Sleeper</a> have a good opportunity to do us justice, at<span class='line-break'> </span>least so far as your report goes.</p>

<p>"That the subject of a revision of the By-Laws,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the printing of the same in connection with<span class='line-break'> </span>a new edition of the Catalogue be referred to<span class='line-break'> </span>a Committee of three Trustees.</p>
<p>The Chair nominated Messrs <a href='/pages/subjects/56312' title='Norcross, Otis'>Norcross</a>, <a href='/pages/subjects/54832' title='Austin, Edward'>Austin</a> and<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/54833' title='Bowditch, J.

<p><del>I will confine myself to what has been talked of, and<span class='line-break'> </span>to which no objection, that I am aware of, has been raised:<span class='line-break'> </span>although, in the judgment of many, other reforms are possible.</del></p>

<p><del>198</del> 220</p>
<p>I have myself experienced much incon<span class='line-break'></span>venience from a confused arrangement of<span class='line-break'> </span>the By-laws. This is not impugning the<span class='line-break'> </span>wisdom or skill of others, but merely stating<span class='line-break'> </span>that no printed by-laws had been used before<span class='line-break'> </span>1857, and the arrangement has not since been <span class='line-break'> </span>changed. Experience (which we were then without<span class='line-break'> </span>in this matter) has taught me that an<span class='line-break'> </span>improvement should be made in this<span class='line-break'> </span>particular. The difficulty chiefly occurs<span class='line-break'> </span>in finding a particular by-law. For exam<span class='line-break'></span>ple, the subject of the "laying out of lots" (art 17) is<span class='line-break'> </span>sandwiched in between "Interments" (art 16) and<span class='line-break'> </span>"<a href='/pages/subjects/61319' title='Public Lot'>Public Lots</a>" (art 18) which <del>two</del> last two are upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the same subject: and again art 18. "<a href='/pages/subjects/61319' title='Public Lot'>Public Lots</a>",<span class='line-break'> </span>which belongs in the category of Interments, comes in<span class='line-break'> </span>between 17, Laying out of lots &amp; 19 "Sales &amp; Conveyances." --</p>
<p>I could go an and instance other cases, but<span class='line-break'> </span>instead of doing so, propose to make such<span class='line-break'> </span>suggestions as have occurred to me, in the order<span class='line-break'> </span>in which the articles now stand, and conclude<span class='line-break'> </span>with the change which I propose in the arrange<span class='line-break'></span>ments. --</p>

<p>Art 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>d</sup></p>
<p>In relation to ^<sup>whether a member of the Corporation can have more than one vote &amp; </sup> the <ins>mode</ins> of voting by proxy - [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>charter is [?]. The only allusion to proxy voting is in Sec. 56<span class='line-break'> </span>where, in stating that business may be transacted at any meeting<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Corporation, it says: "And all questions shall be decided<span class='line-break'> </span>by a majority of the members present and voting either in per<span class='line-break'></span>son or by proxy." "Members" are defined in Sec 3.<sup>d</sup> to be<span class='line-break'></span>"All persons who shall hereafter become proprietors of lots in<span class='line-break'> </span>said Cemetery, of a size not less, each, than three hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>square feet."</p>
<p>It will be observed that there is nothing in the<span class='line-break'> </span>language of the charter, which indicates whether a member<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be entitled to a <ins>stock vote</ins> or one proportional to his<span class='line-break'> </span>interest; or only to his personal vote. - And I do not<span class='line-break'> </span>know that the question has ever been mooted in the Board<span class='line-break'> </span>of Trustees, or in the Corporation; but I have often heard it<span class='line-break'> </span>asked by individuals; and I have answered that, "so<span class='line-break'> </span>there are I am aware, each proprietor of a lot of 300 feet<span class='line-break'> </span>may cast only one vote in his own right: and if represent<span class='line-break'></span>ing the lot of another individual or the heirs of such, he <del>was</del> ^<sup>is</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>entitled to one other vote."</p>
<p>At the first, and for many years, scarcely a proprietor<span class='line-break'> </span>held more than one lot. Now there are quite a number,<span class='line-break'> </span>whom hold more than one, but not more than six or seven<span class='line-break'> </span>lots of 300 feet each: - which fact would seem to render it<span class='line-break'> </span>important to settle in the by-laws each one's right in<span class='line-break'> </span>this respect.</p>
<p>Upon examination of the Statutes relating to other kindred<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporations, I am satisfied that the analogy<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>of this case leads to the conclusion that each proprietor<span class='line-break'> </span>of a lot containing 300 square feet &amp; upwards is entitled<span class='line-break'> </span>to a vote proportional to his interest.</p>
<p>[the rest of this page appears to be deleted?]</p>
<p>In. Gen. Stats. Ch. 28. Sec. 2. <u>Proprietors of Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporations</u> are invested with the powers and privileges,<span class='line-break'> </span>and are made subject to the duties, restrictions and liab<span class='line-break'></span>ities of Chap. 68, and the first sixteen sections of Ch. 67 of<span class='line-break'> </span>Gen. Stats. -</p>
<p>Chap. 68, Sec. 7, "Corporation may by their bylaws, where<span class='line-break'> </span>no other provision is specially made, determine xxx the<span class='line-break'> </span>number of shares that shall entitle the members to one or<span class='line-break'> </span>more votes; the mode of voting by proxy"; &amp;c.</p>
<p>If it were doubtful whether this was not [intend?]<span class='line-break'> </span>to apply to stock rather than Cemetery Corporations, it<span class='line-break'> </span>appears to me there can be no doubt of the applica<span class='line-break'></span>bility of Sec, 12 of Chap. 67 to our case, which is:</p>
<p>"Each proprietor shall be entitled to vote according<span class='line-break'> </span>to the number of his shares <u>or the [?] of his interest</u><span class='line-break'> </span>when the same is known, and when not known, the<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors shall vote equally. Absent proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>may vote by proxy authorized in writing."</p>
<p>As this provision (which is under "Proprietors of Wharves, Gen<span class='line-break'> </span>eral Fields and Real Estate lying in Common") not only goes<span class='line-break'> </span>back to the <del>General</del> Revised Statutes, but was enacted as early<span class='line-break'> </span>is 1785, and as the General Statutes relating to Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporations adopt that provision by way of reference, there<span class='line-break'> </span>can be no reasonable doubt that the same provis<span class='line-break'></span>ion is applicable &amp; the Charter of this Corporation; and<span class='line-break'> </span>that if the Trustees see fit to adopt the principle</p>

<p>involved in it into the by-laws, such by-laws will not [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>repugnant to the laws of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>How then does it apply here? It is the privilege usually<span class='line-break'> </span>accorded to a purchaser to receive the deed of as many<span class='line-break'> </span>lots as are divisible by 300 square feet: i.e. if he buys<span class='line-break'> </span>1500 feet, and wishes it laid out in five lots without<span class='line-break'> </span>passageways, no objection is made, any more [?] sell<span class='line-break'> </span>him five lots laid out contiguously, or [?] in<span class='line-break'> </span>the Cemetery, each of which he may transfer to differ<span class='line-break'> </span>ent persons, each of whom will have a vote. But<span class='line-break'> </span>if a purchaser has waived their right by taking his<span class='line-break'> </span>land in one enclosure as one lot, there is no reason<span class='line-break'> </span>to extend to him the advantages of this provision.</p>
<p>The owner of five lots each of which contains 300 square<span class='line-break'> </span>feet or upwards, upon the principle above laid down<span class='line-break'> </span>will be entitled to five votes. There would seem to be no<span class='line-break'> </span>more reason why this privilege should not enure here,<span class='line-break'> </span>than in the case of "proprietors of several fields," and<span class='line-break'> </span>those whose interest is greater should have more con<span class='line-break'></span>trol than others whose interest is less. - For example, <span class='line-break'> </span>the man who owns 299 feet has no voice at all. - <span class='line-break'> </span>If then a certain number of feet was requisite, in the judgment<span class='line-break'> </span>of the originators of their Cemetery, to give a man any voice or<span class='line-break'> </span>control, why should not twice, or three, or ten times as<span class='line-break'> </span>many give him more control. -</p>

<p>The provisions as to <ins>Banks</ins>, ch. 57 Gen. Stat.<span class='line-break'> </span>(p. 304) seem too cumbersome, and inapplicable to<span class='line-break'> </span>a Corporation like this.</p>
<p>The provisions as to Insurance Companies, Ch. 58,<span class='line-break'> </span>Sec. 27 (p. 323) are: "Each share shall be entitled to<span class='line-break'> </span>one vote.

<p>The provisions stating to Manuf<sup>g</sup> &amp; other Corpor<span class='line-break'></span>ations organized under Special Charters are: --</p>
<p>Ch. 60, p.337  "At all meetings of the Company about stockholders may<span class='line-break'> </span>vote by proxy authorized in writing: but no proxy shall be<span class='line-break'> </span>valid unless executed and dated within six months previous<span class='line-break'> </span>to the meeting at which it is used, if the maker thereof resides<span class='line-break'> </span>in the U.S.; and no person shall as proxy or attorney cast<span class='line-break'> </span>more than fifty votes, unless all the shares so represented<span class='line-break'> </span>by him are owned by one person; and no office of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation as proxy or attorney shall cast more than twenty<span class='line-break'> </span>votes." --</p>
<p>How far any of the foregoing provisions can be<span class='line-break'> </span>made to suit the case of our Corporation, if they can<span class='line-break'> </span>be made so at all, the Trustees must determine. --</p>

<p>My own impression is that the use of proxy<span class='line-break'> </span>votes, at all, does more harm than good, by<span class='line-break'> </span>giving encouragement to some designing or malicious<span class='line-break'> </span>man to obtain a large number among a constitu<span class='line-break'></span>ency so scattered, and overthrow or build up<span class='line-break'> </span>as he chooses: and especially, it does harm by<span class='line-break'> </span>leading members to send their proxy instead of<span class='line-break'> </span>personally attending the meetings.</p>
<p>Before the year <date when='1855'>1855</date>, I am informed it was<span class='line-break'> </span>not usual for a dozen persons to be present at<span class='line-break'> </span>the annual meetings, and since then, with one excep<span class='line-break'></span>tion, I doubt whether more than seventy five have<span class='line-break'> </span>been present). I believe the number will not average<span class='line-break'> </span>more than fifty voting members out of 3500<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors. Any device which would secure<span class='line-break'> </span>the attendance of a larger number of persons ought to<span class='line-break'> </span>be adopted by the Trustees -- whether by personal<span class='line-break'> </span>notice, or regulating the manner of voting by proxy.</p>
<p>Of course proxy voting must be allowed, unless<span class='line-break'> </span>an amendment of the Charter is obtained. If you<span class='line-break'> </span>desire to restrict it, a certain definite time, as three<span class='line-break'> </span>[missing word] six months, within which proxies shall be obtained<span class='line-break'> </span>ought to be adopted.

The Com. on Grounds "have general charge of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Grounds, <ins>trees</ins>, avenues and paths in the Cemetery:"<span class='line-break'> </span>and again, in this article -- "Trees standing <ins>within<span class='line-break'> </span>lots</ins> can be removed, if desired, by an application<span class='line-break'> </span>from the proprietor to the Sup<sup>t</sup>, subject to the ap<span class='line-break'></span>proval of the Com. on Grounds." --</p>
<p>Now, as the Com. on Lots are understood to<span class='line-break'> </span>have the general supervision of lots, and as nearly all<span class='line-break'> </span>the questions that can possibly arise between indiv<span class='line-break'></span>idual proprietors or between them and the Corpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion must have reference to their rights or wishes<span class='line-break'> </span>connected with their lots, it is manifest that the<span class='line-break'> </span>right of the Com. on Grounds to decide about the<span class='line-break'> </span>removal of trees <ins>within</ins> lots might easily involve<span class='line-break'> </span>the two Committees in a conflict of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>I merely suggest this for the consideration<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Com.<sup>ee</sup> without proposing a specific amend<sup>t</sup>.</p>
<p>Then as to the <ins>terms</ins> of removal of trees<span class='line-break'> </span>within lots. I think the Sup<sup>t</sup> is usually obliged<span class='line-break'> </span>to charge for such service; and it ought to be<span class='line-break'> </span>so stated. -- After the words "if desired" -- in the 2<sup>d</sup> line,<span class='line-break'> </span>add -- "at the expense of the proprietor." --</p>
<p>As the by-law now reads, I do not think this<span class='line-break'> </span>would be inferred. --</p>

<p>They therefore recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees to amend the By-law upon that<span class='line-break'> </span>subject by striking out the following words in the<span class='line-break'> </span>second clause of Art. 29 --</p>
<p>"The Trustees may also<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>guarantee</ins> the perpetual repair of lots, containing three<span class='line-break'> </span>hundred feet and upwards, on the payment to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer of a sum not less than three hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars, and of lots containing less than three hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>feet on the payment of a sum not less than one hun<span class='line-break'></span>dred dollars." --</p>

<p>The Committee on Lots further recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>that the present printed form of contract for per<span class='line-break'></span>petual repair be amended by inserting the word<span class='line-break'> </span>"forever" -- after the words, "to keep" -- in the 2<sup>d</sup> clause.<span class='line-break'> </span>and adding at the end of the clause. --</p>

<p>The accompanying blank contains informa<span class='line-break'></span>tion for the direction of heirs and devisees upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the decease of a proprietor.

<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>Will you have the<span class='line-break'> </span>kindness to get the accompanying bill before the<span class='line-break'> </span>Judiciary Com<sup>ee</sup>.</p>
<p>The <ins>first</ins> reason for its passage is that uni<span class='line-break'></span>versal custom as well as the fitness of the thing has<span class='line-break'> </span>made the office of Cemetery Corporations the only place for<span class='line-break'> </span>the record of its deeds.</p>
<p>The <ins>second</ins> reason is that, in the absence of any<span class='line-break'> </span>general law authorizing such record there always has<span class='line-break'> </span>been and will continue to be a considerable solic<span class='line-break'></span>itude in the minds of lot owners, as to their rights<span class='line-break'> </span>without county registration, and the more timid ones often<span class='line-break'> </span>dispel their doubts by sending their deeds to the county records.</p>
<p>The <ins>third</ins> reason is that there is already a large<span class='line-break'> </span>^<sup>and constantly increasing</sup> aggregation of interest in Cemetery lots in this Common<span class='line-break'></span>wealth, at stake, if the validity of title can be called in<span class='line-break'> </span>question for want of proper registration. -- These lots being<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>real estate</ins>, the act would be essentially a question of<span class='line-break'> </span>titles, and I am not aware of any objection that can be <span class='line-break'> </span>raised.</p>
<p>The State of <a href='/pages/subjects/70558' title='Maine'>Maine</a> has passed a similar act: what other<span class='line-break'> </span>states, if any, I am not aware.</p>
<p>I hand you a bound book containing our Charter, also the form of deed.</p>

If they can be in<span class='line-break'></span>duced to enlarge and fit up<span class='line-break'> </span>this, it will make quite an <span class='line-break'> </span>improvement.</p>
<p>Please then give me the width<span class='line-break'> </span>on the back of the two lots which<span class='line-break'> </span>you could add leaving a suffic<span class='line-break'></span>ient passageway to the lots on <a href='/pages/subjects/60336' title='Willow Avenue'>Willow<!--Ave--></a>.<span class='line-break'> </span>(By the plan there appears to be 10 ft or more),<span class='line-break'> </span>also the width &amp; length of the strip<span class='line-break'> </span>next to Greenleaf.

<p>State the price at which you<span class='line-break'> </span>would sell. --</p>
<p>Please reply in person on<span class='line-break'> </span>Saturday -- that will answer Mr<span class='line-break'> </span>Howard's purpose as he wishes to<span class='line-break'> </span>send to his brother by next steamer. --</p>

<p>I send you the <span class='line-break'> </span>contract ready for your signature<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; for paying over the amount<span class='line-break'> </span>mentioned therein.

<p>In reply to your question, I<span class='line-break'> </span>will say that the amount is intended<span class='line-break'> </span>to cover the lot and "all" its appartenan<span class='line-break'></span>ces.

At last I thought<span class='line-break'> </span>he might be absent, &amp; went to his<span class='line-break'> </span>house to inquire. Finding that he was<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>not</ins> away from home (although out of the<span class='line-break'> </span>house, &amp; I did not see him) I wrote<span class='line-break'> </span>another note reminding him of my<span class='line-break'> </span>former. He replied by mail that<span class='line-break'> </span>he did not care to enter into an<span class='line-break'> </span>arrangement at present for perpet<span class='line-break'></span>ual care. I then waited to see<span class='line-break'> </span>the Chairman of the Com<sup>ee</sup>. This<span class='line-break'> </span>is the month when people are<span class='line-break'> </span>easy at business, and I did not<span class='line-break'> </span>see him until three or four days<span class='line-break'> </span>ago. I asked him if the Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>could approve of $300 independently<span class='line-break'> </span>of the arrangement for both lots, and<span class='line-break'> </span>rec<sup>d</sup> a negative reply: that $350 is not<span class='line-break'> </span>too much in your case. In times when<span class='line-break'> </span>a paper dollar was worth a dollar in gold,<span class='line-break'> </span>no <ins>less</ins> than $300 would have been asked<span class='line-break'> </span>of you. I regret you have had <span class='line-break'> </span>to wait so long, but you perceive it has<span class='line-break'> </span>not been <ins>my</ins> neglect. -- I return you one of our<span class='line-break'> </span>forms of contract, in case you wish to carry through the<span class='line-break'> </span>arrangement at once, it will save you the trouble of visiting again before reading the contract.<span class='line-break'> </span>Sign it -- Enclose a draft payable to my order (the Treas<sup>r</sup> is absent just now) &amp; will acknowledge the rec<sup>t</sup> of it, &amp; get contract completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a href='/pages/subjects/71442' title='Burroughs, Dr., Rev.'>Rev<sup>d</sup> Dr. Burroughs</a></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your brother brought<span class='line-break'> </span>in a note from you a few days <span class='line-break'> </span>since in which you were pleased to refer<span class='line-break'> </span>to my judgment respecting the improve<span class='line-break'></span>ment of your lot at Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>in terms of confidence, and asking<span class='line-break'> </span>him to advise with me as to the kind<span class='line-break'> </span>of fense &amp;c. to be erected.</p>
<p>I have since learned from the Super<span class='line-break'></span>intendent that nothing has been done<span class='line-break'> </span>to the lot, as he waited for instructions<span class='line-break'> </span>from somebody, and supposed he should<span class='line-break'> </span>soon receive them. He does not usually<span class='line-break'> </span>put parties to unnecessary expense,<span class='line-break'> </span>as he would do in enforcing at once<span class='line-break'> </span>what you will perceive from your<span class='line-break'> </span>deed is the rule -- i.e. within sixty days<span class='line-break'> </span>grade bound &amp; number the lot, unless<span class='line-break'> </span>the proprietor proceeds to do so,<span class='line-break'> </span>where he supposes they intend to enclose<span class='line-break'> </span>the lots with granite curb, or even<span class='line-break'> </span>iron fence. No expense has therefore<span class='line-break'> </span>been incurred, and if you intend<span class='line-break'> </span>to go on with the erection of a fence<span class='line-break'> </span>it is best to let the grading of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot remain until that is done.</p>
<p>Now, as to the style of fence.<span class='line-break'> </span>Whether you have iron or stone -- there<span class='line-break'> </span>are so many varieties, and it is so much<span class='line-break'> </span>a question of taste for the proprietor to<span class='line-break'> </span>decide upon himself, that it is unwise<span class='line-break'> </span>for anyone to undertake that task<span class='line-break'> </span>for him. Iron fences are liable to<span class='line-break'> </span>rust, unless frequently painted, and<span class='line-break'> </span>are rather out of date now, as there is<span class='line-break'> </span>a growing feeling that a cemetery while<span class='line-break'> </span>is well protected with a high iron en<span class='line-break'></span>closure does not need the additional<span class='line-break'> </span>protection to it, small subdivisions<span class='line-break'> </span>or lots in the form of other iron fences,<span class='line-break'> </span>though this feeling, &amp; the finding</p>

<p>The contract for perpetual repair<span class='line-break'> </span>embraces the lot and its appurtenan<span class='line-break'></span>ces -- "the monument, fence, trees,<span class='line-break'> </span>shrubbery &amp; said thereon." The Com<span class='line-break'></span>mittee on Lots are charged with the<span class='line-break'> </span>duty of seeing that these funded<span class='line-break'> </span>lots shall be kept in good order.<span class='line-break'> </span>Consequently they, in accordance with<span class='line-break'> </span>the By laws visit and inspect<span class='line-break'> </span>the lots twice a year. If anything<span class='line-break'> </span>does not appear to be in good<span class='line-break'> </span>condition they at once direct<span class='line-break'> </span>the Superintendent to put the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot in good repair. [This review?]<span class='line-break'> </span>applies to the <ins>guaranteed</ins> lots and<span class='line-break'> </span>not to all who may deposited money,<span class='line-break'> </span>because, in some cases, the income<span class='line-break'> </span>of the funds may be insufficient<span class='line-break'> </span>for the purpose. But if the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation once gives the guaranty,<span class='line-break'> </span>it matters not whether the funds<span class='line-break'> </span>are sufficient or not, they are<span class='line-break'> </span>bound to take good care of it.<span class='line-break'> </span>It is customary to paint fences<span class='line-break'> </span>about every three years: this is<span class='line-break'> </span>usually found sufficient. <ins>Good</ins> paint<span class='line-break'> </span>will look very well for that time.</p>
<p>As to any future erections upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot -- that would have to be con<span class='line-break'></span>sidered.

You will see by the accompanying documents that that you<span class='line-break'> </span>reported upon them <date when='1862-01-02'>Jany. 2, 1862</date>. Since then a monument has been<span class='line-break'> </span>erected on the lots, which will of course increase the cost, to<span class='line-break'> </span>say nothing of the change of rates made by the Com. on Lots, although<span class='line-break'> </span>I am not prepared to say the Com. would think it necessary to <span class='line-break'> </span>increase the $500 each aside from the monument. However,<span class='line-break'> </span>I wish you to go over the matter again with care and<span class='line-break'> </span>report, or add the mon<sup>t</sup> to your report.</p>
<p>Then please take in another element. Mr Tufts has<span class='line-break'> </span>a piece of ornamental ground containing 300 feet, which Mrs <span class='line-break'> </span>Tufts thinks they might like to sell or let the Corp<sup>n</sup> have in part payment.<span class='line-break'> </span>I have made a sketch from our plan of all the surrounding lots, in order<span class='line-break'> </span>that you may study this over and see whether you can fix up a 300 ft<span class='line-break'> </span>lot there with granite in the shape in which this would have to later and<span class='line-break'> </span>find a ready customer. Probably the ornamental was measured to the in<span class='line-break'></span>side of curb of <a href='/pages/subjects/60204' title='lot 2870'>lot 2870</a>, and you could not get more than 200 to 250 ft<span class='line-break'> </span>but I don't know how that is. It must not encroach on Meacham's --<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/74537' title='Lot 3029'>lot 3029</a>. They have 400 feet in lot -- 440 ft ornamental and 252 ft passage<span class='line-break'></span>ways.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have carefully inquired<span class='line-break'> </span>into the matter of complaint of <a href='/pages/subjects/79864' title='Folsom, George M.'>Geo. M. Folsom</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>contained in the enclosed note, respecting the alleged<span class='line-break'> </span>breaking of the <a href='/pages/subjects/79865' title='Damon, Edward T.'>Damon Monument</a> on "<a href='/pages/subjects/60405' title='Harvard Hill'>Harvard Hill</a>"<span class='line-break'> </span>and have learned from the Superintendent, whose<span class='line-break'> </span>statements are [?] by others having proper<span class='line-break'> </span>means of knowledge, that the monument was <span class='line-break'> </span>observed prostrated <del>what</del> a year or more [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>on the next day after a fierce northwest gale<span class='line-break'> </span>which blew down a large pine tree within a<span class='line-break'> </span>hundred and fifty feet of this monument, tearing<span class='line-break'> </span>the tree out by the roots. The stump of the tree<span class='line-break'> </span>still remains there in position as it fell. Both<span class='line-break'> </span>the tree and monument fell in the same direc<span class='line-break'></span>tion -- up hill, i.e. the S.E. -- The Superintendent feels<span class='line-break'> </span>confident that the gale prostrated the stone.</p>
<p>Not so much for curiosity, as to examine<span class='line-break'> </span>the form and strength of this stone, I determined<span class='line-break'> </span>to visit the spot: and this I was unable to<span class='line-break'> </span>do until yesterday, which must be my apology<span class='line-break'> </span>for so long delay in making a <ins>written</ins> reply<span class='line-break'> </span>to the charge.

<p>I found the tree &amp; stone fallen as stated<span class='line-break'> </span>by <a href='/pages/subjects/55278' title='Winsor, Daniel L., Capt.'>Capt Winsor</a>. The Stone is in Gothic style,<span class='line-break'> </span>surmounted by a cross, had stood on a base made<span class='line-break'> </span>tapering upwards to the height of 15 or 16 inches, ter<span class='line-break'></span>minating in an oblong socket of about 2 inches in depth,<span class='line-break'> </span>[to receive?] the bottom of the tablet. The tablet is say<span class='line-break'> </span>2 or 3 inches thick, four feet three inches high and<span class='line-break'> </span>two feet wide, and differs but little from an or<span class='line-break'></span>dinary grave stone in the surface which it presents<span class='line-break'> </span>and its capacity -- for resisting a strong wind: excepting<span class='line-break'> </span>that its [single?] position on the base rendered it more<span class='line-break'> </span>liable to be blown down.</p>
<p>The Stone appeard to have fallen nearly clean<span class='line-break'> </span>from the bottom of the socket, and in its fall to have<span class='line-break'> </span>broken in two in the middle. A portion of the stone<span class='line-break'> </span>however was left in the socket, which I took out with<span class='line-break'> </span>my fingers and have brought along &amp; send you,<span class='line-break'> </span>to let you see the nature of the stone as to the strength<span class='line-break'> </span>of materials. I think you will perceive that<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/55278' title='Winsor, Daniel L., Capt.'>Capt Winsor</a> did not overstate the matter, when<span class='line-break'> </span>he said that a weaker or meaner stand he never<span class='line-break'> </span>saw wrought into a monument.</p>
<p><a href='/pages/subjects/79864' title='Folsom, George M.'>Mr Folsom's</a> informants should state his<span class='line-break'> </span>means of knowledge, when he says that the "workman<span class='line-break'> </span>at Mount Auburn have broken and infused the<span class='line-break'> </span>monument". So far as I can learn, this<span class='line-break'> </span>statement was made from an inference<span class='line-break'> </span>that no work was going on last summer<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>In the case of <a href='/pages/subjects/79890' title='Gallagher, William'>W<sup>m</sup> Gallagher</a><span class='line-break'> </span>Co K. 59<sup>th</sup> Mass. Vols. Died <date when='1864-08-13'>Aug. 13. 1864</date>, <del>allow</del></p>
<p>Allow me to state why the claim should be<span class='line-break'> </span>taken from the suspended list, and settled in<span class='line-break'> </span>behalf of the claimant.</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> There is no real contradiction in the two<span class='line-break'> </span>deposition of witnesses Conolly and Delaney when under<span class='line-break'></span>stood -</p>
<p>2<sup>d</sup> The claimant and the witnesses are both of<span class='line-break'> </span>the highest respectability, so far as I can learn -</p>
<p>3<sup>r</sup> The necessities of claimant's family urges haste.</p>
<p>Under the first head there cannot have been the slightest<span class='line-break'> </span>intention to vary from the truth. The term "perjury" is a<span class='line-break'> </span>cruel word in this case. The claimant and witnesses told<span class='line-break'> </span>a fair story, with all the appearance of truthfulness. She stated<span class='line-break'> </span>that <a href='/pages/subjects/79893' title='Gallagher, John'>her brother John</a> was in the army, and she was ashamed<span class='line-break'> </span>to say deserted, that he was a "bad behaved boy," that he<span class='line-break'> </span>went away, and neither she nor her friends had heard from<span class='line-break'> </span>him for years, or I understood them. That they had seen<span class='line-break'> </span>an account of a destructive explosion and his name<span class='line-break'> </span>was among the names of the killed, and they verily believed<span class='line-break'> </span>that he was the person felt satisfied that he was.<span class='line-break'> </span>They had no doubt of his death, and as they were<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>355</p>
<p>so well satisfied of it, although the means of verifica<span class='line-break'></span>tion were not at hand, I wrote out the testimony<span class='line-break'> </span>of the witnesses, without thinking a more particular<span class='line-break'> </span>statement necessary; and it was signed and<span class='line-break'> </span>sworn to as a bona fide statement according to their<span class='line-break'> </span>best knowledge and belief. They still believe their<span class='line-break'> </span>first statement to be true.</p>
<p>When you asked for more particular proof as to<span class='line-break'> </span>what had become of other heirs, I made a more<span class='line-break'> </span>formal inquiry, and found that I could not substan<span class='line-break'></span>tiate <a href='/pages/subjects/79893' title='Gallagher, John'>John Gallagher's</a> death from record evidence, and<span class='line-break'> </span>did not know of whom to inquire, as the alleged incident<span class='line-break'> </span>took place on the other side of the continent. It then<span class='line-break'> </span>occurred to me that I ought to have used the fact of<span class='line-break'> </span>his desertion, as that was positively stated. The claimant<span class='line-break'> </span>at first gave me the wrong regiment by mistake, and I<span class='line-break'> </span>could not find it for some time. But the moment she<span class='line-break'> </span>corrected the error, I found that <a href='/pages/subjects/79893' title='Gallagher, John'>John Gallagher</a> stands<span class='line-break'> </span>upon the Massachusetts rolls as a deserter, as shown<span class='line-break'> </span>by the certificate sent. I accordingly prepared the<span class='line-break'> </span>last testimony to meet their fact.</p>
<p>It is no less true now than before that the claimant<span class='line-break'> </span>and the witnesses are satisfied of the death of said John, but<span class='line-break'> </span>as the means of proof were not at hand, I shaped the<span class='line-break'> </span>language so as to leave that a matter of belief rather<span class='line-break'> </span>than certainty. I sent the paper to <a href='/pages/subjects/64824' title='Waltham, MA'>Waltham</a>, ten miles<span class='line-break'> </span>away, and the witness executed it there.</p>

<p>We are nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>ready to print a new plan of our<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery on a scale sufficiently large<span class='line-break'> </span>to show every proprietor his lot<span class='line-break'> </span>in good order.

<p>I do not find any map<span class='line-break'> </span>paper in this market and do<span class='line-break'> </span>not wish to be driven to New<span class='line-break'> </span>York to get it.</p>
<p>We wish about ten reams<span class='line-break'> </span>38 in x 46 in say <del>65</del> <sup>70</sup> lbs to rm.<span class='line-break'> </span>or about 700 lbs.</p>
<p>I inquired at <a href='/pages/subjects/79948' title='Jones, P. C., Mr.'>Mr. P.C.<span class='line-break'> </span>Jones'</a>, or rather got them<span class='line-break'> </span>to inquire of your house<span class='line-break'> </span>and my answer was that<span class='line-break'> </span>you were not for prepared to <span class='line-break'> </span>make so small a quantity,<span class='line-break'> </span>and would have to wait for<span class='line-break'> </span>an accumulation of orders.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The Superintendent<span class='line-break'> </span>has examined the lots of your<span class='line-break'> </span>father &amp; uncle (J.B.C) and I<span class='line-break'> </span>think the President happened to be<span class='line-break'> </span>with him.

<p>He says both want new<span class='line-break'> </span>grading and sodding, and<span class='line-break'> </span>the monument on your lot<span class='line-break'> </span>is somewhat cracked, although<span class='line-break'> </span>it may not give out for twenty<span class='line-break'> </span>or thirty years.</p>

<p>A few days since<span class='line-break'> </span>your brother Francis desired me<span class='line-break'> </span>to ascertain the am<sup>t</sup> for which<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation would <ins>guarantee</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>the perpetual repair of your family<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/65849' title='Lot 1341'>lot no 1341</a>. and inform you<span class='line-break'> </span>of the result.</p>
<p>I wrote the Supt. asking him<span class='line-break'> </span>to report upon the condition of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot in the usual manner,<span class='line-break'> </span>and instead of the report he<span class='line-break'> </span>has written me as follows:</p>
<p>"I have examined the <span class='line-break'> </span>"Humphrey Lot."

<p>I believe I promised<span class='line-break'> </span>to send you a statement of the granite<span class='line-break'> </span>posts needed for points /or surveyors,<span class='line-break'> </span>which you were to order: -</p>
<p>150 posts - from 2 1/2 to 3 feet long - <span class='line-break'> </span>not less than 2 1/2 feet. The <ins>small</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>end to be six inches square, with<span class='line-break'> </span>a drill hole in the centre, say an<span class='line-break'> </span>inch deep. The surveyor prefers they<span class='line-break'> </span>should be tapering, to heave less with frost.</p>
<p>The sooner we have these<span class='line-break'> </span>on the ground, the better it will<span class='line-break'> </span>please the surveyor.</p>

<p>In case<del>s</del><span class='line-break'> </span>where a lot is sold with a<span class='line-break'> </span>condition to erect a granite curb within<span class='line-break'> </span>a specific time, as I understand yours<span class='line-break'> </span>is one - the deed is not delivered<span class='line-break'> </span>until the condition is performed.</p>
<p>The proprietor is not com<span class='line-break'></span>pelled (I will say in answer to<span class='line-break'> </span>your question) to employ the Corpor<span class='line-break'></span>ation to put up his granite work;<span class='line-break'> </span>but it must be done under the su<span class='line-break'></span>pervision of the Superintendent.</p>

As we shall have about $312 left<span class='line-break'> </span>in the fund after your bill for repairs is in (that is<span class='line-break'> </span>if your bill is $45.) I am anxious to induce the pro<span class='line-break'></span>prietor to pay in enough more to make it up to<span class='line-break'> </span>a guaranty: and I don't believe I can do it, if<span class='line-break'> </span>$400 is required.

<p>Two years ago last Autumn<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees appropriated $2350 for preparing, com<span class='line-break'></span>pleting and delivering the Catalogue and plan of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Cemetery.</p>

<p>There is yet to be rendered a small bill - not exceeding<span class='line-break'> </span>$15. I think for^<sup>additional</sup> work by binder on same: and<span class='line-break'> </span>I submit to you the accompanying bill, being<span class='line-break'> </span>entirely for moneys paid out by me, and none<span class='line-break'> </span>(379.27) of which I have received back.

<p>By another memorandum you will see that my<span class='line-break'> </span>sales of maps up to January, and moneys rec<sup>d</sup> for<span class='line-break'> </span>advertising on the cover^<sup>of catalogue</sup> will more than pay my bill.</p>
<p>If there is anything which you wish to understand more<span class='line-break'> </span>fully, I will explain.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The 29<sup>th</sup> by-law requires you<span class='line-break'> </span>annually before the 1<sup>st</sup> Monday in April to report<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Trustees a list of all lots out of repair, &amp;c. --<span class='line-break'> </span>The first and last report of such lots was made<span class='line-break'> </span>in the spring of 1865, and embraced a few more than<span class='line-break'> </span>a hundred lots. In connection with this subject,<span class='line-break'> </span>it was found that many of the lots are still<span class='line-break'> </span>without stone or iron bounds: and these you proposed,<span class='line-break'> </span>a year or two since to report upon -- but I think<span class='line-break'> </span>the snow frustrated your work. Late in Autumn or<span class='line-break'> </span>early in Spring is the only practicable time for this. --<span class='line-break'> </span>I suggest that you endeavor this time to put<span class='line-break'> </span>on <a href='/pages/subjects/79942' title='Safford, Frederick Marcy'>Fred</a> or some one that you are satisfied can<span class='line-break'> </span>do this work accurately. I don't know who you have<span class='line-break'> </span>besides <a href='/pages/subjects/79942' title='Safford, Frederick Marcy'>Fred</a>. that can. You now have a good plan<span class='line-break'> </span>to work by. I would examine all lots by the plan<span class='line-break'> </span>^<sup>&amp; catalogue</sup> following the avenues &amp; path in course, making a x on<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot or plan, &amp; writing against the number in the catal<span class='line-break'></span>ogue a letter for what is wanted as N.S. for<span class='line-break'> </span>new sodding, P. for painting fence and B. for stone<span class='line-break'> </span>bounds, or whatever initials you may think best,<span class='line-break'> </span>making of course more extended notes where<span class='line-break'> </span>needed.</p>

<p>Can you not, as fast as you get the raking<span class='line-break'> </span>along, have this work going on? I presume<span class='line-break'> </span>there are comparatively few cases where raking<span class='line-break'> </span>the leaves would be an assistance to this work.</p>
<p>The Committee some time since decided<span class='line-break'> </span>to have all the unbounded lots reported, and<span class='line-break'> </span>posts put to them.</p>
<p>I have before me some papers that have<span class='line-break'> </span>been a good while on my files, &amp; wish to finish the<span class='line-break'> </span>matter.

<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I feel much mortified at my long<span class='line-break'> </span>neglect of your note of <date when='1867-11-27'>Nov<sup>r</sup> 27<sup>th</sup> [18]67</date>, inquiring where<span class='line-break'> </span>you "can procure such a jet as is in <a href='/pages/subjects/58209' title='Asa Gray Garden'>the Lawn<span class='line-break'> </span>Fountain</a>". --</p>
<p>First let me thank you for the beautiful "Hand<span class='line-break'></span>book for <a href='/pages/subjects/65969' title='Green-wood Cemetery, Brooklyn'>Greenwood</a>" by Mr Cleveland. It is exe<span class='line-break'></span>cuted in a style of rare elegance.</p>
<p>I was unusually engaged in the winter in pre<span class='line-break'></span>paration &amp;c. connected with the removal of our<span class='line-break'> </span>office, and since being here have found difficulties in<span class='line-break'> </span>replying lucidly to the question, owing to the fact that<span class='line-break'> </span>the jet, while in use in two or three places, was made<span class='line-break'> </span>by persons now away. Still it is thought by two<span class='line-break'> </span>or three of whom I have inquired that it can<span class='line-break'> </span>be easily produced.</p>
<p>I have finally been advised to refer you to<span class='line-break'> </span><a href='/pages/subjects/81827' title='Mott&apos;s Iron Works'>Mott's Iron Works</a> 266 Water St, <a href='/pages/subjects/64140' title='New York, NY'>New York</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; enclose the card of <a href='/pages/subjects/81828' title='Messrs Lockwood &amp; Lamb'>Messrs Lockwood &amp; Lamb</a> giving<span class='line-break'> </span>the reference. If you have any difficulty of getting it<span class='line-break'> </span>made there, and wish one, I have no doubt they<span class='line-break'> </span>can do it here. I understand that it is<span class='line-break'> </span>a very simple thing: it might be called "the reversed<span class='line-break'> </span>umbrella jet". If I can be of further aid, command<span class='line-break'> </span>my services.</p>

<p>Your note respecting the lot of<span class='line-break'> </span>the late <a href='/pages/subjects/81830' title='Butler, Pierce'>Pierce Butler</a> &amp;c. is rec<sup>d</sup>.</p>
<p>I enclose the usual form of transfer, which<span class='line-break'> </span>will be found in blank on the 3<sup>d</sup> page of the<span class='line-break'> </span>deed of his <a href='/pages/subjects/81831' title='Lot 434'>lot (434)</a> if said deed can be found.</p>
<p>If Mr Butler left a will, it should first<span class='line-break'> </span>appear from it who are the heirs to the lot. As<span class='line-break'> </span>lots in the Cemetery are declared by the Charter<span class='line-break'> </span>to be real estate, it would pass (if not specifically<span class='line-break'> </span>mentioned) either under a general clause or a residu<span class='line-break'></span>ary clause. A copy of so much as covers this<span class='line-break'> </span>ground attested by the Recorder, with the date of<span class='line-break'> </span>the instrument, and of registration, would be all that<span class='line-break'> </span>we should require to ascertain who are the heirs.</p>
<p>If he died intestate, then let the heirs in making<span class='line-break'> </span>conveyance to <a href='/pages/subjects/81832' title='Kemble, Mrs.'>Mrs Kemble</a> (if that course is desired)<span class='line-break'> </span>refer to the fact in the ^<sup>blank</sup> transfer sent or the other if found.</p>
<p>In either case, they would use the blank transfer.<span class='line-break'> </span>If the claim under the will, they would use some such<span class='line-break'> </span>clause as this: "Know all men" &amp;c "that we, _____ of ____<span class='line-break'> </span>____ of ____  &amp;c ^<sup>[residuary heirs]</sup> devisees under the will of P.B. late of " &amp;c --<span class='line-break'> </span>If no will, "that we, ___   ___   ___ being the children &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>only heirs at law of P.B. late of who died intestate," --</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Out Treas<sup>r</sup>, <a href='/pages/subjects/54274' title='Bond, George William'>Mr Bond</a>, has sent <span class='line-break'> </span>me your note of <date when='1868-05-13'>May 13<sup>th</sup></date> requesting me to reply to it:</p>
<p>I regret to perceive that you have got an erro<span class='line-break'></span>nous impression in the matter. The bill as <span class='line-break'> </span>I see, is $53.25 for the first grading and sodding<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot. Your lot (no <a href='/pages/subjects/67186' title='Lot 3530'>3530</a> <a href='/pages/subjects/61235' title='Mound Avenue'>Mound Avenue</a>) was<span class='line-break'> </span>graded up with a line of lots of which <a href='/pages/subjects/67213' title='Collier, Mr.'>Mr Collier</a>'s<span class='line-break'> </span>is first and <a href='/pages/subjects/60648' title='Clark, E.

Your land (400 feet) as you find<span class='line-break'> </span>in your deed cost you $600. This was for land in<span class='line-break'> </span>its naked condition. You may have got the idea that<span class='line-break'> </span>the $600 covered the whole from the fact that it was<span class='line-break'> </span>graded when you first saw it. The reason we make<span class='line-break'> </span>the charge for the land and grading separate is<span class='line-break'> </span>that we divide proceeds of land with the <a href='/pages/subjects/54281' title='Massachusetts Horticultural Society'>Massa<span class='line-break'></span>chusetts Horticultural Society</a>, and it has no interest<span class='line-break'> </span>in the work -- so we keep separate accounts, &amp; the<span class='line-break'> </span>bills are rendered separately to the purchaser.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>For the greater facility of reg<span class='line-break'></span>ulating the accounts, and to render ourselves less<span class='line-break'> </span>liable to mistakes, you will please make the<span class='line-break'> </span>following changes in the practice of accounts &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>payments at the Gate: --</p>
<p>I wish your account such as we can<span class='line-break'> </span>enter upon the cash book in detail as rec<sup>d</sup> from<span class='line-break'> </span>you. So, instead of starting the account with a<span class='line-break'> </span>statement of the money you hold, &amp; ending in the same<span class='line-break'> </span>manner, I wish the account to correspond with the<span class='line-break'> </span>amount of money you remit me. Begin with<span class='line-break'> </span>the first item received, and transcribe from your<span class='line-break'> </span>cash book just as far as will make the amount<span class='line-break'> </span>of money you wish to remit, after charging the<span class='line-break'> </span>payments: So that the difference between receipts &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>payments will be the amount remitted.</p>
<p>Then as to paying bills -- such bills are can<span class='line-break'> </span>easily be paid at this office, as for instance, <a href='/pages/subjects/93776' title='Runey, John'>John<span class='line-break'> </span>Runey</a>, &amp; <a href='/pages/subjects/93777' title='Morss &amp; Whyte'>Morss &amp; Whyte</a> in the <date when='1868-06-06'>June 12<sup>th</sup></date> a/c, get them<span class='line-break'> </span>approved, &amp; send them here for payment.</p>
<p>Instead of carrying the pay of ^<sup>casual</sup> laborers into the acct,<span class='line-break'> </span>pay them, keep the vouchers, enter the amt on the next payroll,<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; I will settle with you when I pay.</p>

<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I have had occasion through<span class='line-break'> </span>several recent calls made upon me for the pur<span class='line-break'></span>pose which is hereinafter stated, to examine<span class='line-break'> </span>the will of the late <a href='/pages/subjects/64871' title='Pelby, William'>W<sup>m</sup> Pelby</a>: and a more<span class='line-break'> </span>involved piece of legal lore I have rarely met<span class='line-break'> </span>with -- speaking from a lawyer's standpoint.<span class='line-break'> </span>I have studied it severely, and learned what<span class='line-break'> </span>I could from the other sources of the parties in interest<span class='line-break'> </span>and can only say -- "It's a pity that <a href='/pages/subjects/64871' title='Pelby, William'>Mr Pelby</a><span class='line-break'> </span>could not have looked through the maze of history<span class='line-break'> </span>of his family, and seen what it would come to --<span class='line-break'> </span>and all but a few sentences would have been <span class='line-break'> </span>saved of this long document.</p>
<p>So much for preamble. I am informed<span class='line-break'> </span>that <a href='/pages/subjects/95417' title='Hague, Julia'>Mrs Julia Hague</a>, and <a href='/pages/subjects/95418' title='Roby, Sophia'>Mrs Sophia Roby</a> --<span class='line-break'> </span>the half sisters of <a href='/pages/subjects/64871' title='Pelby, William'>Mr Pelby</a> -- are the only surviving<span class='line-break'> </span>heirs.

I have heard it intimated<span class='line-break'> </span>that there is but little intercourse between these<span class='line-break'> </span>ladies, but know nothing about it, and only refer<span class='line-break'> </span>to the matter to say that in a matter of this<span class='line-break'> </span>kind it is important that they should waive<span class='line-break'> </span>differences, so that the lot may not go unrepresen<span class='line-break'></span>ted. If, however, parties will not concur, the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees are authorized to appoint a person --<span class='line-break'> </span>one or the other heir.

<p>If you get the concurrence of the ladies --<span class='line-break'> </span>that is -- their signature in favor of one of them --<span class='line-break'> </span>so much of the work will have been done.

<p>I am sorry for <span class='line-break'> </span>the brevity of your communication<span class='line-break'> </span>in reply to mine respecting the Pelby<span class='line-break'> </span>lot.

If Mrs H. disclaims all<span class='line-break'> </span>connection with and ownership<span class='line-break'> </span>in the tomb, it is very proper to<span class='line-break'> </span>say so, and if her sister does the<span class='line-break'> </span>same, the Trustees will then under<span class='line-break'></span>stand what course to pursue.<span class='line-break'> </span>They will order the tomb closed<span class='line-break'> </span>and regard everyone as barred<span class='line-break'> </span>from exercising any authority in<span class='line-break'> </span>regard to it. But if, on the<span class='line-break'> </span>other hand, Mrs Hague desires<span class='line-break'> </span>to retain her interest in and right <span class='line-break'> </span>over the lot, I think she should<span class='line-break'> </span>answer more particularly the<span class='line-break'> </span>questions I asked. She has<span class='line-break'> </span>indeed signed the paper sent, but<span class='line-break'> </span>has not indicated her wishes<span class='line-break'> </span>in case <a href='/pages/subjects/95418' title='Roby, Sophia'>Mrs Roby</a> refuses.<span class='line-break'> </span>But I first wish to know<span class='line-break'> </span>where <a href='/pages/subjects/95418' title='Roby, Sophia'>Mrs Roby</a> is, before<span class='line-break'> </span>I can ascertain whether she<span class='line-break'> </span>refuses.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In reply to your<span class='line-break'> </span>communication of <date when='1869-04-20'>Jany 26<sup>th</sup></date> re<span class='line-break'></span>specting care of your lot this season,<span class='line-break'> </span>I have waited to inquire at Mt<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn before replying.</p>
<p>No proper care can be given<span class='line-break'> </span>to your lot for "three or three<span class='line-break'> </span>and a half dollars". It is<span class='line-break'> </span>a fine lot among other beautiful<span class='line-break'> </span>lots, none of which have less<span class='line-break'> </span>than $8.00 worth of work for<span class='line-break'> </span>cutting grass &amp; plants.</p>
<p>If you wish it to be in <span class='line-break'> </span>keeping with other lots in the<span class='line-break'> </span>neighborhood, you should <span class='line-break'> </span>give us your order for "care <span class='line-break'> </span>of lot for 1869, with <u>plants</u> $8.00."</p>
<p>Or we will keep the grass<span class='line-break'> </span>well cut for $5. -- Your lot<span class='line-break'> </span>has 400 feet, &amp; these rates<span class='line-break'> </span>are the same that we have<span class='line-break'> </span>for lots of 200 feet --</p>
<p>Only the smallest lots<span class='line-break'> </span>can be taken for such rates<span class='line-break'> </span>as you named.</p>
<p>The price at <a href='/pages/subjects/95421' title='Forest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain'>Forest Hills<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery</a> (as per circular before <span class='line-break'> </span>me) "for the annual care of a lot<span class='line-break'> </span>of 300 feet, with flowers is 8.00:<span class='line-break'> </span>for a lot of 300 feet without<span class='line-break'> </span>flowers $5.00."</p>
<p>I trust you will not<span class='line-break'> </span>let so beautiful a lot<span class='line-break'> </span>fall behind -- for after all,<span class='line-break'> </span>a fine [lot] cannot well be neglected<span class='line-break'> </span>for a single year.

<p>Yours of 9<sup>th</sup> with $4. for<span class='line-break'> </span>bill of 1868 on the <a href='/pages/subjects/95708' title='Davis, I. T., Mr.'>I.T.

<p>As I am accustomed to gather<span class='line-break'> </span>from the Probate offices the facts con<span class='line-break'></span>nected with the estate of deceased<span class='line-break'> </span>persons as bearing upon the<span class='line-break'> </span>inheritance of their burial lots, I had<span class='line-break'> </span>noted an intricate class of facts con<span class='line-break'></span>nected with the Davis Estate.

<p>As there is not likely to be another<span class='line-break'> </span>rise of land for a long time, I hope<span class='line-break'> </span>you will get your lot located,<span class='line-break'> </span>as that is the only advantage which<span class='line-break'> </span>can be derived from neglecting to do<span class='line-break'> </span>so, while there is the disadvantage<span class='line-break'> </span>of the best average land being taken.</p>
<p>I hope you are not laboring under<span class='line-break'> </span>the error that one holding a certif<span class='line-break'></span>icate like yours, can go in and<span class='line-break'> </span>select where he chooses.

<p>I can show you the difference<span class='line-break'> </span>between the receipt which you<span class='line-break'> </span>hold, and that formerly given.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I should have written<span class='line-break'> </span>you before on the following matter, if I<span class='line-break'> </span>had not the impression that you were<span class='line-break'> </span>still ^<sup>at the</sup> South.</p>
<p>The Committee on Lots have<span class='line-break'> </span>considered your application to know<span class='line-break'> </span>for what sum the Corporation will<span class='line-break'> </span>assume the perpetual care of <a href='/pages/subjects/74143' title='Lot 1114'>lot<span class='line-break'> </span>no. 1114</a> in the Cemetery, and have<span class='line-break'> </span>directed me to inform you that<span class='line-break'> </span>such contract will be entered into<span class='line-break'> </span>on payment of <u>five hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars</u> ($500) when the lot shall<span class='line-break'> </span>have been put in good repair. --</p>
<p>The repairs estimated each<span class='line-break'> </span>needed by the Sup<sup>t</sup> are<span class='line-break'> </span>as follows: --</p>
<p><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>1000 feet sods</th> <th>37.50<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>1 cord manure</td> <td>12.00</td> </tr> <tr><td>Cleaning monument</td> <td>8.00</td> </tr> <tr><td>10 days labor</td> <td>23.80</td> </tr> <tr><td>[total]</td> <td>81.30</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> This you perceive does not take<span class='line-break'> </span>in painting fence, which you propose<span class='line-break'> </span>now to do. I presume the <a href='/pages/subjects/55278' title='Winsor, Daniel L., Capt.'>Sup<sup>t</sup><!--D.L.W.--></a> thought<span class='line-break'> </span>it would do a year or two<span class='line-break'> </span>longer. I remember it is painted<span class='line-break'> </span>white, but looks much better than<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot generally.</p>
<p>The ^<sup>estimated</sup> cost of repairs seems large --<span class='line-break'> </span>but is not really so: for instance<span class='line-break'> </span>1000 feet sods -- There is, you know,<span class='line-break'> </span>a very high bank on the avenue side<span class='line-break'> </span>of your lot.</p>
<p>From the prominent position of<span class='line-break'> </span>this lot, I sincerely trust you<span class='line-break'> </span>may find it convenient to carry<span class='line-break'> </span>out your design to place it in charge<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Corporation.</p>

<p>There is no <u>material</u> difference<span class='line-break'> </span>between your views and those of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Com<sup>ee</sup>. The Superintendent in his<span class='line-break'> </span>note of last August, of which I<span class='line-break'> </span>sent you a copy, overestimated the<span class='line-break'> </span>value of your fence and old<span class='line-break'> </span>posts, as he now states.

Will you please advise me whether there<span class='line-break'> </span>is anything in the condition of these Lots which, by the rules of<span class='line-break'> </span>the corporation, or by custom, would preclude the making and<span class='line-break'> </span>delivery of the deeds to the purchasers forthwith?</p>
