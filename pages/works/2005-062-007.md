<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor of Jan'y 7<sup>th</sup> just rec'd.<span class='line-break'> </span>I enclose a plan, showing dimensions of lot and distance <span class='line-break'> </span>from path, also the levels of lot &amp; path.<span class='line-break'> </span>The size of thelot is 14'x15', and you can place a curb<span class='line-break'> </span>not exceeding 1 foot in thickness outside of these dimensions,<span class='line-break'> </span>if it is less than 1 foot in thickness it must be placed its thickness<span class='line-break'> </span>outside of these dimensions.</p>
<p>The distance from inside of lot curb to outside of any curb<span class='line-break'> </span>or plots in path is 5'-6".<span class='line-break'> </span>The path is 3'6" below grade of <u>rear</u> of lot, and 2 ft below<span class='line-break'> </span>front of lot.</p>
<p>After the lot is curbed the grade of land outside the curb<span class='line-break'> </span>will remain as now, the lot itself being raised according <span class='line-break'> </span>to height of your curb.</p>
<p>When you pattern is selected, should be glad to <span class='line-break'> </span>arrange to set it for you, &amp; will give you good work at<span class='line-break'> </span>a reasonable price</p>

<p>This is rather closer figuring<span class='line-break'> </span>than is absolutely safe and of <span class='line-break'> </span>course would not allow of brick <span class='line-break'> </span>catacombs being built</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed is a plan which I offer as<span class='line-break'> </span>a substitute for the present plan for laying out that part<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Stone Farm between Magnolia, Swan &amp; Eagle Avenues and<span class='line-break'> </span>the Iron Fence.</p>
<p>A copy of the present laying out is in your posession or at<span class='line-break'> </span>the Boston office, and the proposed charges are shown on the<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosed plan in red.</p>
<p>I consider the advantage of the proposed plan to be that<span class='line-break'> </span>the laying out conforms more nearly with the natural<span class='line-break'> </span>surface, that the means of drainage will be better, and<span class='line-break'> </span>the curve &amp; winding avenues will present a more pleasing<span class='line-break'> </span>appearance than long and straight ones.</p>
<p>As work is now underway which would be somewhat effected by<span class='line-break'> </span>this change. I should be glad to know the decision of the<span class='line-break'> </span>committee as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that the Trustees would not consent<span class='line-break'> </span>to any change of grade unless the lot was <u>curbed</u><span class='line-break'> </span>as well as posted. The grade of the lot now is 12<span class='line-break'> </span>inches above the path, and the stakes should be<span class='line-break'> </span>cut for this rise. I send you a sketch of the lot that<span class='line-break'> </span>your stone cutter may make the ^<sup>stakes of</sup> proper length to reach<span class='line-break'> </span>from lot to the path line.</p>
<p>When the front steps are ready, I should be very<span class='line-break'> </span>glad to have them set for you by our masons who<span class='line-break'> </span>do most all the work of this kind in the cemetery &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>who will give you entire satisfaction at a reasonable<span class='line-break'> </span>price.

<p>The corporation has taken the care of your lot for a<span class='line-break'> </span>number of years, and I know of no reason why<span class='line-break'> </span>the work has not been satisfactory, so that I hope you<span class='line-break'> </span>will continue the care of the lot with the corporation.</p>
<p>It is the desire of the Trustees that all work in the<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery should be done by the regular Employees<span class='line-break'> </span>of the corporation as far as it is acceptable to proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>of both.</p>
<p>Unless I hear from you to the contrary I will take<span class='line-break'> </span>the care of your lot as usual, and if anything in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>to the work is not satisfactory, I will endeavor to have it<span class='line-break'> </span>changed.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>

<p>In regard to your inquiries about #1340 Cypress A.<span class='line-break'> </span>The Trustees will probably make no objection<span class='line-break'> </span>to taking the lot under perpetual care as it<span class='line-break'> </span>now is, with the Fence, after the same is<span class='line-break'> </span>painted. They would prefer, probably to take the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot without any fence cast or anything of the<span class='line-break'> </span>kind, with simply a granite post at each corner<span class='line-break'> </span>to mark the boundaries, but do not insist, upon<span class='line-break'> </span>the removal of the fence. In fact the objections<span class='line-break'> </span>to a fence apply with equal force to curbs<span class='line-break'> </span>or other enclosures. The probable cost of Perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>Care of this lot after the fence is painted will be<span class='line-break'> </span>$650 to $700. - We can paint the fence when you<span class='line-break'> </span>desire it done.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to your inquiry as<span class='line-break'> </span>to the cost of perpetual care of the sod on single lots<span class='line-break'> </span>in the old Cemetery, I hand you the following figures which<span class='line-break'> </span>are the actual amounts charged to 29 lots of different<span class='line-break'> </span>sizes from 1870 to 1875 inclusive, a period of six years. These<span class='line-break'> </span>figures include all moneys spent for the care, top dressing spending<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lots and repairs &amp; renewal of sod. During the three years<span class='line-break'> </span>(1873,4,5) which I have had the care of the lots, the cost<span class='line-break'> </span>has been charged for at the same rates as for work done<span class='line-break'> </span>for proprietors, and therefore there was some 10% profit on<span class='line-break'> </span>this work, as there are no bad debts to allow for during<span class='line-break'> </span>1870, 1 and 2, the work  done on perpetual care lots appears<span class='line-break'> </span>to be charged for at rates higher than these charged proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>for the same work.</p>

<p>I have received<span class='line-break'> </span>no order as yet for any work on<span class='line-break'> </span>lot 524 "Loring" for the year 1876.</p>

<p>I should be glad to execute<span class='line-break'> </span>any orders you may see proper<span class='line-break'> </span>to give me.</p>

<p>Henry S. [Evers?] Esq</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I send you a plan of the Sturrgis lot<span class='line-break'> </span>#3511 showing the amount of land owned &amp; its position<span class='line-break'> </span>with reference to the adjoining lots, and on this plan I<span class='line-break'> </span>have sketched a plan of the catacombs &amp; the vestibule, showing <span class='line-break'> </span>the amount of land available for the front &amp; sides of tomb.</p>
<p>I enclose a sketch of a tomb containing 16 catacombs, to<span class='line-break'> </span>which can be added such a design for the front and<span class='line-break'> </span>entrance as suits you. The parts colored in red represent<span class='line-break'> </span>the brickwork and then in slate color, the slate shelves on which<span class='line-break'> </span>the caskets rest, and the divisions between the catacombs.</p>
<p>I think the divisions between the catacombs are best of slate<span class='line-break'> </span>and the catacomb doors of marble.</p>
<p>I think the entire cost should not exceed $4500 unless the<span class='line-break'> </span>granite front is more elaborate than the Moore tomb which you<span class='line-break'> </span>saw. The more difficult place to arrange the grade will be on<span class='line-break'> </span>the East side toward lot #2761, and on this side some granite<span class='line-break'> </span>work (dressed) may be made.</p>
<p>Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to Lot #2272, Kendale<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietor, I find that it has never come to the<span class='line-break'> </span>knowledge of the gardener or myself, that any other<span class='line-break'> </span>persons than the corporation were doing or had any<span class='line-break'> </span>authority to do work on the lot.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the work was actually<span class='line-break'> </span>done by the corporation, for which they charge.</p>

<p>J.M. Spelman Esq<span class='line-break'> </span>Prest.</p>
<p>I estimate the cost of building in the New Receiving<span class='line-break'> </span>Tomb, a section of fifty six (56) catacombs according to the plan<span class='line-break'> </span>I have [seen?], in place of then now there; at $4350, which includes<span class='line-break'> </span>all necessary excavations and the removal of the present sections, but<span class='line-break'> </span>no grading &amp; sodding.</p>
<p>The [walls?] are to be of hard brick on good foundation, all laid in<span class='line-break'> </span>cement; the catacombs to have slate shelves, brick division [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>faced with slate, and marble doors. The arch of large brick fitted with<span class='line-break'> </span>face brick, and coated with asphalt.

<p>The vestibule can be tiled &amp; cleaned for $460.00 and the granite<span class='line-break'> </span>arch taken off and relaid after repairing the arch &amp; coating it with<span class='line-break'> </span>asphalt, the front cleaned &amp; painted for $550. Total on vestibule $1010.--</p>

<p>The order left here<span class='line-break'> </span>by you for the care of 2583 with the<span class='line-break'> </span>price named at $4.00 I must respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>decline to execute.

This year (1876) owing to the reduction in price<span class='line-break'> </span>the regular charge should be $7.00 for care.

<p>In lot 551 of Mrs Esther Holbrook of<span class='line-break'> </span>Charleston S.C. one of the freestone corner posts is broken<span class='line-break'> </span>and the fence on one side is also broken, this very <span class='line-break'> </span>much injures the appearance of this and surrounding<span class='line-break'> </span>lots.

<p>I applied to Mr. Geo. F. Wilde for information<span class='line-break'> </span>and was by him referred to you. If you can<span class='line-break'> </span>furnish me with the requisite authority I would like<span class='line-break'> </span>to have you; if not able to do so will you kindly furnish<span class='line-break'> </span>me with the address of the person to whom I must<span class='line-break'> </span>apply.</p>

<p>Your letter of June 7<span class='line-break'> </span>is received.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your letter of the 24^th^<span class='line-break'> </span>inst I would say that I know of no way in which<span class='line-break'> </span>plastering can be put on a tomb, which is at<span class='line-break'> </span>all durable. I think the plastering cannot be removed neatly.<span class='line-break'> </span>For a new tomb I should  recommend using [face?]<span class='line-break'> </span>brick, but this could not be used on your tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>without building the vestibule and that would be<span class='line-break'> </span>expensive.</p>
<p>I have never seen any marble used, but should think<span class='line-break'> </span>possibly it might be used as a lining; I should think<span class='line-break'> </span>the expense of this would be about $450. I think you<span class='line-break'> </span>could probably get this done cheapest by going directly<span class='line-break'> </span>to one of the large marble [fe..?] in Boston. If I can<span class='line-break'> </span>assist you in any way I will do so with pleasure.</p>

<p>Dear Madam<span class='line-break'> </span>[5 &amp;? Dwight?] So. B.</p>
<p>Your letter of [even? date?] herewith is<span class='line-break'> </span>this moment received. I can have the two graves<span class='line-break'> </span>mounded, and planted with myrtle, as you request<span class='line-break'> </span>but must strongly advise against mounding for<span class='line-break'> </span>various reasons. This manner of planting is<span class='line-break'> </span>very uncommon. It would be, almost, impossible<span class='line-break'> </span>to make myrtle so planted live because in a dry<span class='line-break'> </span>time the mound would be the first part of the<span class='line-break'> </span>surface to dry up, and this plant needs moisture<span class='line-break'> </span>to thrive, again after a year or two the growth of the<span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle would assume the form of, a mound.</p>
<p>We always prepare the ground by enriching it [&amp;c?]<span class='line-break'> </span>and plant the myrtle on a flat surface. To properly<span class='line-break'> </span>prepare &amp; put in the myrtle will cost $7.00 per grave.</p>
<p>This I can have done very soon after receiving<span class='line-break'> </span>your decision.</p>

<p>To raise lower step will cost<span class='line-break'> </span>$12.00. The first way is the one<span class='line-break'> </span>I should advise.</p>
<p>There is no way I know of<span class='line-break'> </span>whereby the water can be prevented<span class='line-break'> </span>from standing on the path for a short time<span class='line-break'> </span>after a hard shower. A [cesspool?] to<span class='line-break'> </span>be of any service must be large &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>therefore expensive, and that even would<span class='line-break'> </span>not always insure dryness after heavy<span class='line-break'> </span>showers, say like those of yesterday.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor of July 26^th rec'd. I have examined<span class='line-break'> </span>the tomb carefully and fail to find anything the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>with the granite. The granite was washed off the first<span class='line-break'> </span>of the week, probably since you heard from Miss Sturgis.</p>
<p>I went to the tomb with her on Monday I think. Nothing<span class='line-break'> </span>was said there about the granite or marble. The tiles which<span class='line-break'> </span>are newly set are not yet thoroughly dry and the moisture<span class='line-break'> </span>in the cement had spread from them a little way up<span class='line-break'> </span>the marble front. This will dry out in time, and if<span class='line-break'> </span>the tiles need it they can be washed off again<span class='line-break'> </span>when dry. I do not like to set tiles without cement or<span class='line-break'> </span>lime in a tomb, and yet find in almost every lot<span class='line-break'> </span>of tiles set, that some become somewhat discolored.</p>
<p>I expect to come to Mt Desert by the Lewiston tonight &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>if you desire further conversation on the subject, you will<span class='line-break'> </span>find me for a day or two at The Rockaway House or if you<span class='line-break'> </span>will let me know, I will call on you.</p>

<p>The terms of the sale of the<span class='line-break'> </span>ornamental addition to your lot have been<span class='line-break'> </span>carefully considered, but the Committee on Lots feel that they have<span class='line-break'> </span>already made a considerable concession in selling you<span class='line-break'> </span>an ornamental land at a lower rate, land which is<span class='line-break'> </span>entirely suitable, and as readily sold as usual, for<span class='line-break'> </span>a burial lot, which makes a difference in the amount<span class='line-break'> </span>received by us of $234. -- and this they did because<span class='line-break'> </span>you had done so much to make your lot an [attrac<span class='line-break'></span>tive? one?]. The other lots have been sold with the under<span class='line-break'></span>standing that every lot on the new territory was to be under<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] care and the trustees passed a vote to this effect<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] any sales were [?] which they do not see that<span class='line-break'> </span>[?].</p>
<p>I would call your attention to the fact that all the price<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] that [now?] and are much lower than in the old Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>and [?] a deduction was made to you by your taking<span class='line-break'> </span>the land as ornamental land.

<p>When you purchased lot #4318 some<span class='line-break'> </span>two years ago the lot was rough graded posted &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>numbered for which a charge of $54.00 was made<span class='line-break'> </span>which was specified on the memo of sale sent you<span class='line-break'> </span>and to which no objection was made at the time.<span class='line-break'> </span>In April 1875 I wrote you a note explaining the<span class='line-break'> </span>charge, in answer I believe, to one sent to the Treasurer<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Corporation by you.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, Miss Stone, I think, inquired the<span class='line-break'> </span>cost of sodding the lot and was informed $36 which with<span class='line-break'> </span>the original charge of $54.00 would make $90 as low a<span class='line-break'> </span>price as is ever charged for the grading sodding &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>posting of the lots of this size.</p>
<p>I think both for your sake and ours the lot should be<span class='line-break'> </span>completed &amp; put in good order, and if you are here at any<span class='line-break'> </span>time, I think I can readily satisfy you that both charges<span class='line-break'> </span>are fair &amp; just ones.

[Litley?], the representative<span class='line-break'> </span>of Lot #1923 (containing 300 sq feet) on Acacia path, desires<span class='line-break'> </span>to purchase a lot on the Stone Farm, provided the corpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion will take his present lot in part payment.</p>
<p>The lot which he would probably select on the Stone Farm<span class='line-break'> </span>is [in a ?], and contains 400 sq feet. The price would be<span class='line-break'> </span>for land $400, perpetual care of grass 400 and for grading, sodding<span class='line-break'> </span>posting &amp; [?] say $75.00, total $875.00.</p>
<p>How much will Mr. [Lilsey?] be allowed for his present lot<span class='line-break'> </span>toward the payment of the new one, and will the Trustees au<span class='line-break'></span>thorise the Secretary to receive back the deed of the old lot (at<span class='line-break'> </span>the value fixed) in exchange</p>
<p>Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor of yesterday<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosing my letter of <span class='line-break'> </span>3^d^ inst to Mr. Snow Is received.</p>
<p>I have been to the lot this morning and find<span class='line-break'> </span>no evidence of there ever having been the grave marks<span class='line-break'> </span>there, the want of which occasioned the complaint</p>
<p>In the case where grave borders are now there, the<span class='line-break'> </span>base stone of the headstones was cut to receive the ends, but<span class='line-break'> </span>the base at the grave that has no borders, appears never<span class='line-break'> </span>to have been so cut. Upon inquiry I find that none<span class='line-break'> </span>of the employees here, most likely to know, recollect<span class='line-break'> </span>any border at all at that grave. I am therefore<span class='line-break'> </span>constrained to believe that the lady had supposed<span class='line-break'> </span>a border where in fact none was ever placed; which<span class='line-break'> </span>might readily happen from a slip of memory</p>

<p>The lot is one which would sell readily I think. It is<span class='line-break'> </span>fenced at present, but if the fence were removed the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot could be enlarged from the passageways so as to<span class='line-break'> </span>make a lot of 550 feet.</p>

<p>By the Exchange you will have a lot 200 sq ft larger,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the new lot will be under perpetual care as<span class='line-break'> </span>far as the grass is concerned.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your favor of Nov 3<sup>rd</sup>, I would<span class='line-break'> </span>say that I have visited your lot, and think a set of steps<span class='line-break'> </span>would be a considerable advantage to the lot. I would not<span class='line-break'> </span>advise any other stonework except perhaps more ornamental<span class='line-break'> </span>posts to mark the lot.</p>
<p>The ornamental posts of granite are worth from $20 to $25 each<span class='line-break'> </span>and you would require 4 on the corners and 1 to mark the<span class='line-break'> </span>division line between #[2654?] and #2266</p>
<p>The steps would be 5 in number, with buttresses and names<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; numbers of both lots are there with 5 plain steps, buttresses &amp; <span class='line-break'> </span>posts on are, or with the [?] posts at entrance<span class='line-break'> </span>and plan buttresses the cost would be about $155 if a [Rockham?]<span class='line-break'> </span>Granite; with posts at top and between [?] steps the cost would<span class='line-break'> </span>be $205 for Rockport granite, and are somewhat less if of<span class='line-break'> </span>Concord or [?] Granite. These prices are in addition to the<span class='line-break'> </span>cost of setting which would be from $30 to $60 according to the<span class='line-break'> </span>style. If you [?] for the stone, delivered at the lot, the corpo<span class='line-break'></span>ration will set the work for you. The corporation [?] furnish the<span class='line-break'> </span>stone work, according to the regulations of the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>Ys truly J.W. Lovering</p>

<p>I would say in reply that neither the Gardener or any<span class='line-break'> </span>one else has any interest [?] in any work done or ma<span class='line-break'></span>terials furnished, all work being done for account of the cor<span class='line-break'></span>poration &amp; even the plants [?] in this [?] greenhouses; nor does<span class='line-break'> </span>any one connected with the corporation receive any compensation<span class='line-break'> </span>Except at a fixed rate pr day or pr month</p>
<p>As far as it is practicable a fixed [?] is in use for each<span class='line-break'> </span>work as is freqently called for when the amount can be deter<span class='line-break'></span>mined beforehand, but of course there are cases where the charges<span class='line-break'> </span>can be made only from the materials &amp; later furnished.</p>
<p>You will probably remember that after the beds had been<span class='line-break'> </span>planted once, the gardener received directions to take up<span class='line-break'> </span>the plants &amp; replace them with something else, and you have<span class='line-break'> </span>been charged only with the <u>plants</u> you [?] kept and [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>the labor &amp; material used in planting the beds.

I find the average<span class='line-break'> </span>depth of water in the lake to be four feet, and that the bottom<span class='line-break'> </span>is [mud?] to a depth of from 3 to 6 feet more.</p>
<p>Probably 4000 yards of filling would be required to<span class='line-break'> </span>build the avenue, the cost of moving which from any part<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Cemetery could not be less than $1000, and at present<span class='line-break'> </span>it would not seem to me that there is that amount of<span class='line-break'> </span>material to spare. If material is bought for the [?], it will<span class='line-break'> </span>cost as much as six hundred dollars more. Beyond this will be<span class='line-break'> </span>the cost of regrading &amp; sodding the banks, which after deducting<span class='line-break'> </span>the value of stone taken out would be four or five hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars, and finally as the avenue is narrow, and the distances<span class='line-break'> </span>between it &amp; the lake [?] it might be necessary to protect [positions?]<span class='line-break'> </span>by a railway Respectfully J.W.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>When I came into office I was informed that the hay<span class='line-break'> </span>and by your end had always been allowed to you from<span class='line-break'> </span>what was [cut?] by the Corporation.</p>
<p>As you are [?] aware, the opportunities [for?] cutting<span class='line-break'> </span>hay are smaller  now than in former years on assessment of<span class='line-break'> </span>the [amount?] of the Cemetery, and in 1874 the corporation was<span class='line-break'> </span>obliged to bring in hay, and again this year I expect to have<span class='line-break'> </span>to do so, and in [view?] of these facts, I fell <u>obliged</u> to notify<span class='line-break'> </span>you that hereafter you must furnish your own hay.</p>
<p>The barn appeared to me last summer to be as [even?]<span class='line-break'> </span>filled as usual, and as the hay lasted this 1875. I do<span class='line-break'> </span>not quite see why we should be so short now, and it has<span class='line-break'> </span>remained to me that you may have borrowed for your heard<span class='line-break'> </span>intending to replace it. I wish you would let me know<span class='line-break'> </span>whether this is the case or not, and if it is how much you <span class='line-break'> </span>have used.</p>
<p>If not, can you suggest any reason why the amount should<span class='line-break'> </span>seem short, as from your previous experience with the same<span class='line-break'> </span>stick you know about what is required. I desire a written reply.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor is received</p>
<p>Annual Care of a lot without plants includes - Cutting<span class='line-break'> </span>grass as often as may be necessary, the number of<span class='line-break'> </span>times varying with the position of the lot and dryness<span class='line-break'> </span>of season from 16 times to 30 times through the growing season<span class='line-break'> </span>it includes watering the plants when needed but does not<span class='line-break'> </span>include watering the grass, a thing which, except on newly<span class='line-break'> </span>sodded lots, is impracticable, in most of the lots, and is<span class='line-break'> </span>very seldom done here, and then, only at an additional cost</p>
<p>The grass, in ordinary seasons keep green &amp; fresh, if care<span class='line-break'> </span>is taken in the cutting. For $250 we put on a top dressing<span class='line-break'> </span>in fall of the very best stable manure that can be bought, of<span class='line-break'> </span>the same quality &amp; quantity that we got $4.00. for in 1875</p>
<p>I do not know the condition of your sod but think<span class='line-break'> </span>you had best give me an order for the care of the lot now<span class='line-break'> </span>so that it may be put in order in early spring and<span class='line-break'> </span>then send me word when you would like to meet</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to the item for<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning stone - in the enclosed file - I would say, that<span class='line-break'> </span>you first ordered the cleaning early in May and it was<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaned as well as it could be [and?] pointed. Later in May<span class='line-break'> </span>you arranged to have this lot graded &amp; sodded and at that<span class='line-break'> </span>time, desired to have te curbing cleaned better when<span class='line-break'> </span>it was represented that this could not be done except by<span class='line-break'> </span>employing a stone cutter.</p>
<p>You are charged [?] and above the prices you agreed on<span class='line-break'> </span>only for the time of the stone cutter &amp; for him [?] what<span class='line-break'> </span>was paid by us.</p>
<p>I hope this will explain the charge satisfactorily to you,<span class='line-break'> </span>if it does not I shall be glad to hear from you, but I<span class='line-break'> </span>am confident that it is correct.</p>
<p>Yours truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to the charges on bill<span class='line-break'> </span>for work on your lot, I would say I know of no errors<span class='line-break'> </span>I understand you to claim none</p>
<p>On the bill for grading &amp; sodding Mrs Lockwood's lot<span class='line-break'> </span>(#4417) is an item of 199 loads of loam and this I<span class='line-break'> </span>believe you desire an abatement on.</p>
<p>In selling the lot it was the intention to sell it<span class='line-break'> </span>as you took it, but, as I am inclined to think I made<span class='line-break'> </span>a statement to you which induced you to think<span class='line-break'> </span>that there was a foot of loam on the lot, [?] ornamental<span class='line-break'> </span>grounds (this being the depth to which it is usualy put on)<span class='line-break'> </span>whereas in reality it was only six inches deep, or overhalf<span class='line-break'> </span>of what was represented, I think it is no more than [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>for me to deduct from the bill the amount of [loam?] necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>to bring the depth to the amount stated. This would be<span class='line-break'> </span>46 loads which as charged would amount to $55<sup>20</sup>. I<span class='line-break'> </span>have requested the Treasurer to send you a corrected bill &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>a prompt settlement will much oblige</p>

<p>I can lay out a lot of 100 feet by dividing one of the<span class='line-break'> </span>lots on Clethra path which overuses two hundred feet at<span class='line-break'> </span>a cost of $240 including all Expense as above.</p>
<p>I suppose by taking lot #887 and relaying it out with two<span class='line-break'> </span>lots, a portion could be kept for the present interments,<span class='line-break'> </span>and a new lot of 200 ft sold for $400, which would put<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole in order and under perpetual care.</p>

<p>In reply to your favor of yesterday<span class='line-break'> </span>I would say that the original amount paid for<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot was $100. and for Mr. [Sohier's?] lot which is<span class='line-break'> </span>twice as large $200.</p>
<p>I should estimate the present value differently, as<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole of your lot is available for burial purposes,<span class='line-break'> </span>and no large sum is needed to put it in order.</p>
<p>Before M<sup>r</sup> Sohier's lot can be made very available<span class='line-break'> </span>a considerable sum must be spent on it, and then<span class='line-break'> </span>a part is too steep to be desirable for burials, and<span class='line-break'> </span>the balance is not of a very useful shape, if^it is desired to make^ many<span class='line-break'> </span>interments in the lot.</p>
<p>For these reasons I should estimate the present value of<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot so [compand?] with M<sup>r</sup> Sohiers, at double the value<span class='line-break'> </span>of his.</p>
<p>Respectfuly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering</p>

<p>The most advisable thing<span class='line-break'> </span>to have done to lot 1151 Pine A.

<p>The other [?] would be to make a gradual<span class='line-break'> </span>slope of the banks that would remain all of<span class='line-break'> </span>which last would cost $50.<sup>00</sup> but we find<span class='line-break'> </span>in our experience that a sodded bank is<span class='line-break'> </span>a constant source of expense &amp; annoyance<span class='line-break'> </span>always out of repair &amp; hardly every satisfactory<span class='line-break'> </span>and therefore recommended in adoption o fthe<span class='line-break'> </span>first plan, or that of lowering the grade of lot<span class='line-break'> </span>to obviate banks.

<p>Your note of yesterday, in regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>the work on your lot reached me this morning and I have<span class='line-break'> </span>first returned from the lot.</p>
<p>I will have the gate repaired at once; I know it was left<span class='line-break'> </span>in order last year, but either the roots of the tree, or the [frat?] has<span class='line-break'> </span>thrown it out of positions. I do not find anything out of the<span class='line-break'> </span>way with the paint, the iron work being thoroughly covered,<span class='line-break'> </span>and no signs of rust being visible. I think you must refer to<span class='line-break'> </span>the [dullness?] of the paint, and however bright &amp; fresh the fence<span class='line-break'> </span>looks when first painted it will rarely keep that appearance thru<span class='line-break'> </span>a winter. However, I will try again, if you wish it.</p>
<p>I think it was a mistake to try to do anything to the sod<span class='line-break'> </span>last year, as the sod is worn out and then is too much shade<span class='line-break'> </span>The lot really needed resodding and I will see that what<span class='line-break'> </span>Expense you have been at, shall not be thrown away.</p>
<p>Hoping that the matter may be arranged to your satisfaction</p>

<p>I do not suppose, therefore, from what was said<span class='line-break'> </span>yesterday that you will care to make the Exchange,<span class='line-break'> </span>but if you should, it can be done in this way; you can<span class='line-break'> </span>sell &amp; remove the curbing, or I will remove it for the [stone?],<span class='line-break'> </span>and then I will give you as many feet on the Stone farm<span class='line-break'> </span>as you now own, that is the cost of a 400 ft lot on the<span class='line-break'> </span>Stone Farm being $1080 under perpetual care, you would<span class='line-break'> </span>pay $630 and lot #228 in exchange, this [latter?] lot not being<span class='line-break'> </span>under perpetual care.</p>
<p>Please advise me at once as to how much land<span class='line-break'> </span>you wish to take.</p>

<p>The Grade of your lot can<span class='line-break'> </span>be raised three inches, but not more, as it would<span class='line-break'> </span>not correspond well with the adjoining lots to make<span class='line-break'> </span>it any higher.

<p>I will remove the fence &amp; posts; and regrade the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>raising the grade as proposed above, with loam, &amp; resod<span class='line-break'> </span>it in the best manner after the corner posts are set for $65<span class='line-break'></span>and the old fence &amp; post.

<p>To take away the fence, put in four new granite<span class='line-break'> </span>corner posts with a number of the lot on one, to cut<span class='line-break'> </span>down the tree in the lot and one outside or both<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; raise the grade as above, also the myrtle graves now there<span class='line-break'> </span>and to resod will cost $55 and the fence &amp; old posts.<span class='line-break'> </span>I think you spoke of wanting another myrtle grave; [w^d^?]<span class='line-break'> </span>[be?] $7^00^ more if put in.</p>
<p>I would advise that the fence be taken away, as<span class='line-break'> </span>I think the lot would be much improved thereby.</p>
<p>The perpetual care with flowers, if there are no<span class='line-break'> </span>headstones or monuments would cost $350 to $400 and<span class='line-break'> </span>if there are monuments it would be more depending<span class='line-break'> </span>on the value and desirability of the stone.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your<span class='line-break'> </span>favor of yesterday, I would say<span class='line-break'> </span>that the headstones in Lot #1327 are<span class='line-break'> </span>soiled and require cleaning at<span class='line-break'> </span>a cut of $3<sup>00</sup>.</p>
<p>The grass on the lot is think, the hedge<span class='line-break'> </span>probably drawing most of the nourish<span class='line-break'></span>ment in the soil.</p>
<p>To have a good turf, the lot should<span class='line-break'> </span>be resodded, and I should advise<span class='line-break'> </span>the removal of the hedge, the present<span class='line-break'> </span>time however is not a suitable<span class='line-break'> </span>time to sod.

This will leave enough<span class='line-break'> </span>of the granite base in view &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>the grade will compare with<span class='line-break'> </span>that of the adjoining lots better<span class='line-break'> </span>than now. The Expense would be<span class='line-break'> </span>$38<sup>00</sup>.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In reply to your favor of the 17<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>inst I would say, that care^$3.50^, plants^$3.00^ &amp; top dressing^$2.75^ amounting<span class='line-break'> </span>to $9<sup>[?]</sup> was ordered on Lot 4256 for the year 1875 but<span class='line-break'> </span>that this mistake the plants were not put in, as<span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup>r</sup> Childs wrote you Sept. 17/75 in answer to your postal.<span class='line-break'> </span>and the amount charged for plants was afterwards<span class='line-break'> </span>ordered leaving the charge for 1875, $6.25</p>
<p>The charges for 1876 were for care^2.75^ and plants^3.00^<span class='line-break'> </span>making $5.25, the rates for that year being less than for<span class='line-break'> </span>1875, all of which work has been faithfully attended to.</p>
<p>This would make the total amount of the bill<span class='line-break'> </span>as it now stands $12<sup>00</sup> which was the amount I<span class='line-break'> </span>supposed had been sent you, and I think that<span class='line-break'> </span>this amount should be settled as it now fuly two<span class='line-break'> </span>years since the first order was given</p>
<p>The rates charged you, were then charged all proprie<span class='line-break'></span>tors for the same work, and the more than they would be<span class='line-break'> </span>now, were first ones at the time they were made.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>On looking at the Channing monu<span class='line-break'></span>ment, I find that the cracks cannot be repaired in<span class='line-break'> </span>any way. Only one of the pieces which form the monument<span class='line-break'> </span>[serves?] to be cracked; this could be replaced, but it<span class='line-break'> </span>would be an expensive matter, I should suppose.</p>
<p>A wooden cover can be made, which will protect<span class='line-break'> </span>it through the winters for $22 of matched sheathing &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>painted, which can be taken down in the spring &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>put up again in the autumn. The present appearance of<span class='line-break'> </span>the monument could be improved by cleaning which<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost from $5 to $8.</p>
<p>The whole of the piece, which is cracked, seems to be<span class='line-break'> </span>in poor condition and likely soon to crumble.</p>
<p>I would like to hear your wishes again, if you will<span class='line-break'> </span>be good enough to drop me a [?].</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In 1874 an order was given<span class='line-break'> </span>for the care of your own &amp; your [mother's?]<span class='line-break'> </span>lot at $10 each. pr year.</p>
<p>In 1875 a notice was sent out<span class='line-break'> </span>stating that there would be a <span class='line-break'> </span>reduction in the price for the care<span class='line-break'> </span>of lots of 300 feet from $5 to $4 [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>lots in proportion.</p>
<p>The price for lots of the same size<span class='line-break'> </span>as yours was fixed at $9<sup>50</sup> [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>being considered the rate "in proportion"<span class='line-break'> </span>to the $4 charge for 300 ft lots.</p>
<p>You have only been charged at<span class='line-break'> </span>the rate which lot of the same size<span class='line-break'> </span>have been charged &amp; the price is<span class='line-break'> </span>less than specified on your order.</p>
<p>Hoping this Explanation of the enclosed<span class='line-break'> </span>bill will be satisfactory</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed please find plan<span class='line-break'> </span>of an underground tomb for your lot.</p>
<p>I propose to build the tomb of good hard brick<span class='line-break'> </span>well lain in cement, dimensions according ot plan<span class='line-break'> </span>will slate shelves for the caskets to rest on. The arch<span class='line-break'> </span>of the tomb is strong enough to carry the monument<span class='line-break'> </span>you propose to place there. There is a flight of brick<span class='line-break'> </span>steps from the surface of lot to the tomb. I can<span class='line-break'> </span>build it without the slate shelves, but it will be very<span class='line-break'> </span>much better with them, as when the caskets are placed<span class='line-break'> </span>on each other, they are likely to [crumble?] in. There are<span class='line-break'> </span>twelve shelves, four on each side, and four at the back.</p>
<p>The cost of building this according to plan, of^large^brick laid<span class='line-break'> </span>in cement, with slate shelves, cemented floor, flight of<span class='line-break'> </span>brick steps and slate covers to stairway, moving over your<span class='line-break'> </span>monuments and placing in position will be $800, and<span class='line-break'> </span>if without the slate shelves $675. I would be glad to hear<span class='line-break'> </span>from you soon, as it will take several weeks to get out the<span class='line-break'> </span>shelves if you take them, as I would most certainly advise you to do.</p>

<p>Your favor of the 15<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>inst received this morning.</p>
<p>I have ordered the slate shelves and<span class='line-break'> </span>[will?] begin on the excavation shortly</p>

<p>I consider it is very desirable<span class='line-break'> </span>that the tomb on your lot #276 should be removed<span class='line-break'> </span>before it is placed under perpetual care.</p>
<p>Catacombs of brick could be built across the back of the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot, with slate covering stones; each catacomb would be<span class='line-break'> </span>deep enough for two boxes, separated by a slate shelf built<span class='line-break'> </span>into the brick work. To build these catacombs of hard brick<span class='line-break'> </span>well laid in cement, with slate covers &amp; shelves, to box 5<span class='line-break'> </span>of the bodies now in the tomb, which would be necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>before they could be moved, to remove all the bodies to<span class='line-break'> </span>another tomb while the work is going on, and to [reailies?]<span class='line-break'> </span>them, &amp; grade and sode the lot leaving all in good<span class='line-break'> </span>order would cost two hundred and ninety dollars ($290),<span class='line-break'> </span>^the material in the old tomb to belong to us.^</p>
<p>This would leave the centre of the lot clear for a monument<span class='line-break'> </span>and all of the lot in front of the monument would be un<span class='line-break'></span>occupied.

<p>I have looked at the Gay tomb as<span class='line-break'> </span>requested and find several large patches of the plastering<span class='line-break'> </span>have fallen. It is too late to replaster this autumn, but<span class='line-break'> </span>it can be done in the spring.</p>

<p>The dry was [?] in cutting as<span class='line-break'> </span>my attention was called to it at<span class='line-break'> </span>the time &amp; if you will examine it<span class='line-break'> </span>you will see that a large part of<span class='line-break'> </span>the head is stuck on in the same way.</p>

<p>As to work being done by other parties, I can not<span class='line-break'> </span>say, but as the rule of the corporation is to allow<span class='line-break'> </span>no one to do work on a lot without written au<span class='line-break'></span>thority from you, and as in this case no such<span class='line-break'> </span>authority has been presented, the [parties?] had no<span class='line-break'> </span>right to work there, if they did.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>I advise^(1<sup>st</sup>)^ the removal<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Tomb &amp; the Grading &amp; Sodding of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot which will cost $40.<sup>00</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>if we take the material of the old<span class='line-break'> </span>Tomb. ^(2<sup>nd</sup>)^ The lot should be Posted &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>numbered which will cost $19.00<span class='line-break'> </span>more. ^(3<sup>rd</sup>)^ If you are to have a foundation<span class='line-break'> </span>built, it will be better to have<span class='line-break'> </span>that done at the same time as<span class='line-break'> </span>we can use part of the materials<span class='line-break'> </span>now then for it. If you propose<span class='line-break'> </span>to put in ornamental posts the<span class='line-break'> </span>(2<sup>d</sup>) recommendation would not need<span class='line-break'> </span>to be carried out</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>The reason that<span class='line-break'> </span>you found the grass uncut May 30<span class='line-break'> </span>was because no order for any work<span class='line-break'> </span>had been given [?] to that date<span class='line-break'> </span>July 5/77 The Gardener took an<span class='line-break'> </span>order to Care for lot for season $3.75<span class='line-break'> </span>Put in plants 3.00<span class='line-break'> </span>Paint Fence black 6.00</p>
<p>The price for care is the same for<span class='line-break'> </span>all lots of same size viz: 300 sq ft $3.75<span class='line-break'> </span>usual no. plants $3.00 and is not departed<span class='line-break'> </span>from in taking orders for the work,</p>
<p>When the grass is cut for the first time so<span class='line-break'> </span>late in the season it costs <u>no</u> more than<span class='line-break'> </span>when it is cut from the beginning as<span class='line-break'> </span>we have usually to water it during<span class='line-break'> </span>the dryest season Very Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>per Childs J.W.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The letter which you sent to the Treasurer<span class='line-break'> </span>(Mr Mackintosh) in regard to the charge for repairs on your<span class='line-break'> </span>curbing has been sent to me.</p>
<p>As far as my Experience goes, no curb have been set here,<span class='line-break'> </span>which do not require occasional [?] &amp; repairs. The [man?]<span class='line-break'> </span>who set the curb, is still in our Employ &amp; a most reliable<span class='line-break'> </span>workman, who has, ever since I have known him, done<span class='line-break'> </span>the best job possible, with the stone furnished.</p>
<p>At the time you had your curb set, it was not the<span class='line-break'> </span>custom to put in clamp, which of course adds much<span class='line-break'> </span>to the strength, &amp; which would also have added to the<span class='line-break'> </span>first cost.</p>
<p>Now, inasmuch as the lot has now been clamped &amp; repaired<span class='line-break'> </span>a carefully as possible, I propose to divide the Expense with<span class='line-break'> </span>you reducing the charge from $55 to $27<sup>50</sup> which [?] I<span class='line-break'> </span>trust be satisfactory to you.

<p>On looking over your plan for putting<span class='line-break'> </span>your lots &amp; placing steps there, a [?] of arranging the<span class='line-break'> </span>matter has [?] to me which will I think be satis<span class='line-break'></span>factory to us [best?]. And that is simply to move Mr.<span class='line-break'> </span>Jones lot over to yours so as to leave no spaceway between<span class='line-break'> </span>or if you prefer both your own lot &amp; Mr Jones' [?] be<span class='line-break'> </span>moved toward each other until they touch, then you<span class='line-break'> </span>can please [one?] set of steps for [?] &amp; the deed<span class='line-break'> </span>can be [attend?] accordingly.</p>
<p>If you do not understand from my note what is<span class='line-break'> </span>proposed, if you will call at the office when you<span class='line-break'> </span>are here again, it can be Explained.</p>
<p>Yrs truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering</p>

<p>Dear Miss Hall</p>
<p>I think the best way to<span class='line-break'> </span>make the sod on your lot look well<span class='line-break'> </span>would be to raise the mounds over <span class='line-break'> </span>the graves &amp; resod them, and to<span class='line-break'> </span>enrich the whole lot &amp; put some<span class='line-break'> </span>grass seed over the whole lot. If this<span class='line-break'> </span>should be done early in the spring<span class='line-break'> </span>I think, the whole lot would be much<span class='line-break'> </span>improved. The whole expense would be<span class='line-break'> </span>($8 00) eight dollars</p>
<p>I think it would improve the ap<span class='line-break'></span>pearance of the lot, to have but the<span class='line-break'> </span>for corner posts, and these set a little<span class='line-break'> </span>lower than now. If you think so too,<span class='line-break'> </span>the posts taken out will pay for the <span class='line-break'> </span>change. The levelling of the graves only would<span class='line-break'> </span>cost less.</p>

<p>Was it your intention<span class='line-break'> </span>yesterday to order care for 1878 for both<span class='line-break'> </span>of J.S. Robinsons Lots viz. No. 340 and no 2852 both<span class='line-break'> </span>on Primrose Pa. or only on no. 340 only.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to your favor of yesterday,<span class='line-break'> </span>I would say that the cost of painting the fence around<span class='line-break'> </span>lots #715 &amp; 716 the past season (1877) would have been, for one<span class='line-break'> </span>Coat $4.50, for two coats $7.50. The charge for a bed<span class='line-break'> </span>of myrtle or the grave of an adulte is $7.00.</p>
<p>These charges would be the same during the next season,<span class='line-break'> </span>being considerably reduced from our rates for 1875 &amp; 1878.</p>
<p>As to the care of the lots the price for care <u>without</u> plants<span class='line-break'> </span>of the whole enclosures (#715 &amp; 716) would have been for<span class='line-break'> </span>the past season $6.50 and for plants $5<sup>00</sup> additional for<span class='line-break'> </span>the amount usually put in, tho' more or less could be<span class='line-break'> </span>spent on plants at your pleasure. For top dressing $4.75</p>
<p>For the next season (1878) the care would be $6.25 with<span class='line-break'> </span>plants additional as before say $5<sup>50</sup>, and top dressing $4.50</p>
<p>I should be pleased to do any work which you may<span class='line-break'> </span>desire done the coming season.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the corporation to do the work at as low<span class='line-break'> </span>rates as possible &amp; it is not done as a source of income in any way.</p>

<p>In reply to your favor of the 25<sup>th</sup> inst,<span class='line-break'> </span>I would say that by taking in the passageways on each side<span class='line-break'> </span>of your lot you will add on one side a little more, and on<span class='line-break'> </span>the other a little less than five feet in width, in all equal<span class='line-break'> </span>to 197 sq feet the price of which would be $1 pr foot.</p>

<p>Mrs. George S.

<p>The annual Expense for covering, repairing &amp;c would be $5.00</p>
<p>In this connection I desire to call your attention to the<span class='line-break'> </span>fact that in lots under perpetual care in which are myrtle graves<span class='line-break'> </span>kept in order under the perpetual care contract, new graves of myrtle<span class='line-break'> </span>are now often planted for repairing which, no provision is made<span class='line-break'> </span>and in fact it is often a difficult matter to know which it has been<span class='line-break'> </span>agreed to take care of and which not. The myrtle [disptaces?] about<span class='line-break'> </span>ten square feet of sod, and costs probably $1 pr. year. The present<span class='line-break'> </span>cost of a myrtle grave is $7.00</p>
<p>I would like to suggest $17. as the price of a myrtle grave<span class='line-break'> </span>under perpetual care in lots where the grass is already under<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care $10 of which amount could be placed in the repair fund.</p>

<p>Your favor of March 20<sup>th</sup> to our<span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer (H.B. Mackintosh) has been forwarded to me and<span class='line-break'> </span>I have been to your lot.</p>
<p>The lot, seen at this season, bears Evidence of consid<span class='line-break'></span>Erable care &amp; the grass is now starting up well thru' the<span class='line-break'> </span>top dressing. The lot will be put in order at once, &amp; should<span class='line-break'> </span>your family when next here find anything unsatisfactory<span class='line-break'> </span>I should consider it a favor if they would speak of it at<span class='line-break'> </span>my office, or write me a line, that it may be rectified.</p>
<p>I think if cut flowers have been placed on the lot, they<span class='line-break'> </span>may not have been removed when faded, as many<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors direct us not to remove them, preferring to<span class='line-break'> </span>do it themselves when ready. There is a wooden trellis<span class='line-break'> </span>on the lot which I think should be removed, as it is broken up.</p>
<p>When here, I think if you would look at the plainting of<span class='line-break'> </span>the fence, and the sodding of the banks in front of the lot,<span class='line-break'> </span>you might think it well to do something to them.</p>

<p>In regard to the Erection of<span class='line-break'> </span>a headstone on your lot over the<span class='line-break'> </span>[size?] mentioned in the deed as the<span class='line-break'> </span>limit, &amp;.c. two and a half feet,<span class='line-break'> </span>about which some of the ladies of<span class='line-break'> </span>the family made inquiries last<span class='line-break'> </span>week, I would say that permission<span class='line-break'> </span>has never been granted Except<span class='line-break'> </span>in the case of proprietors who have<span class='line-break'> </span>been obliged to Exchange their lots<span class='line-break'> </span>and who therefore had the stones all<span class='line-break'> </span>finished, and I think there is<span class='line-break'> </span>great doubt in looking into matter<span class='line-break'> </span>of permission would be granted in<span class='line-break'> </span>any other case. I have therefore thought<span class='line-break'> </span>it best not to present it at the meeting<span class='line-break'> </span>of the trustees, feeling you would not<span class='line-break'> </span>want it done, with probability of refusal</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to the asphalt path<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp;c for which you petitioned the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees, I would say that the great<span class='line-break'> </span>trouble in the look of the front of<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot is caused by the steepness<span class='line-break'> </span>of the grade. If you are willing to<span class='line-break'> </span>bear the Expense of regrading the<span class='line-break'> </span>borders on front of your lot, I will<span class='line-break'> </span>see that the lots on each side do<span class='line-break'> </span>the same, and will have the path<span class='line-break'> </span>properly gravelled, which will put<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole path in order.</p>
<p>The Expense to you which I speak<span class='line-break'> </span>of will not Exceed $15.00 and if<span class='line-break'> </span>you do not understand the plan,<span class='line-break'> </span>Either myself or the foreman will<span class='line-break'> </span>Explain it to you any week day you<span class='line-break'> </span>find it Convenient to Come up.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor of the 9<sup>th</sup> inst<span class='line-break'> </span>received, and I enclose you the order for the<span class='line-break'> </span>additional land on the North side.</p>
<p>I have had the cost of altering the fence looked<span class='line-break'> </span>into, and I find that to take out fence on the<span class='line-break'> </span>North side of your lot, and place across the passageways<span class='line-break'> </span>to connect with M<sup>r</sup> [Farnais?] lot, and to take of the<span class='line-break'> </span>sod then grade it evenly &amp; replace the same sod, will<span class='line-break'> </span>cost $12.00 or if the fence is painted after the alteration $15,<span class='line-break'> </span>(and I see that it needs it.)</p>
<p>I also find that for $5.00 more, or $20 in all I can so arrange<span class='line-break'> </span>the front fence, as to make the gate come in the centre of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot after the addition is made. If you decide to take<span class='line-break'> </span>all or a part of the [Farrar?] lot this will make no difference,<span class='line-break'> </span>but if you are going to take the addition only on the North side<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot will look better to have the gate in the centre.</p>
<p>The myrtle should be planted soon, and as far as agreeable<span class='line-break'> </span>to proprietors, the Trustees are [?] to do <u>all</u> the work on the<span class='line-break'> </span>lots. I will make the alteration in the fence, as soon as I hear from you</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The memorandum which you gave to<span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup>r</sup>. Collins our gardener has been received. The sod is in<span class='line-break'> </span>a bad condition I know, but it is not because it has<span class='line-break'> </span>not had proper attention. With the various [terrains?] necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>on account of the tomb, it is difficult to make a sod do<span class='line-break'> </span>very well, and impossible when there is so much shade.<span class='line-break'> </span>If you will consent to have the two [maples?] removed (which<span class='line-break'> </span>stand on each side of the tomb, I think we can make the<span class='line-break'> </span>sod do very much better, and the tomb can be kept<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaner and the flowers will have the sunlight which they<span class='line-break'> </span>need.</p>
<p>I will see that the [iron?] vase is painted and that the other<span class='line-break'> </span>vases are replaced. The lot will be sodded &amp; put in order as<span class='line-break'> </span>soon as you let me know about the trees. The removal of the<span class='line-break'> </span>maple in the front borders will help the flowers a little but<span class='line-break'> </span>the sod would be a bad as Ever.</p>
<p>Yours truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering.</p>

<p>The myrtle that was<span class='line-break'> </span>placed on the grave of Mr.<span class='line-break'> </span>Copeland has become sunken<span class='line-break'> </span>apparently through some lack<span class='line-break'> </span>of care in digging the adjoining<span class='line-break'> </span>grave; this I propose to repair<span class='line-break'> </span>at our expense.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>An extensive improvement has<span class='line-break'> </span>been underway for several months in the rear of<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot at Mt.

The grade of your lot is about a foot below<span class='line-break'> </span>those on each side and it would be better for<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot and for the appearance of the bank, if the<span class='line-break'> </span>grade were raised to [comprehend?] with the lots on each<span class='line-break'> </span>side. The only difficulty would consist is raising the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence and as this is somewhat out of repair, I write to<span class='line-break'> </span>ask if you would consent to have the fence removed<span class='line-break'> </span>as many proprietors are now doing and I will then<span class='line-break'> </span>grade up the lot leaving four granite boundary posts as<span class='line-break'> </span>on the adjoining lot, without any Expense to you Except<span class='line-break'> </span>that I would sell the fence as old iron, which would give<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] to supply proper boundary posts.

<p>I will have the fences on<span class='line-break'> </span>Mrs Bancroft's lot removed, the posts taken out and the<span class='line-break'> </span>holes filled and sodded, and leave four corner<span class='line-break'> </span>posts with the number of the lot cut on one for the old<span class='line-break'> </span>fence and $5.00.</p>

<p>Mr. Lennox was here in the early spring and wanted<span class='line-break'> </span>the foundation built in the most thorough way, and it<span class='line-break'> </span>was built of block stone in large blocks in the best manner<span class='line-break'> </span>and this was in my opinion necessary owing to the large<span class='line-break'> </span>amount of clay under this and the aspiring lots which<span class='line-break'> </span>has heretofore given some trouble.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have received the bills on lots #[3430?]<span class='line-break'> </span>(Foster) and on your own lot #4383.</p>
<p>I find on examination that the rates charged for<span class='line-break'> </span>work on lot #3430 agree exactly with the orders.</p>
<p>In regard to lot #4383, the order for care is given at<span class='line-break'> </span>$4.00, you have been charged $2.75 the price fixed by the<span class='line-break'> </span>trustees for lots of the size of yours for 1878.</p>
<p>The charge for myrtle is the usual one and also for the<span class='line-break'> </span>ten roses &amp;c</p>
<p>I notice on the back of your bill you have made up the<span class='line-break'> </span>price for heliotrope &amp; tea roses @ $1.50 pr. dozen. Of course<span class='line-break'> </span>the rate for plants ($1.50 pr. dozen) on our order cards only applies<span class='line-break'> </span>to such kinds so we keep on hand &amp; raise. When proprie<span class='line-break'></span>etors order [vanisters?] that we do not keep, but have to<span class='line-break'> </span>send outside for, of course we have to charge accordingly.</p>
<p>No top dressing was ordered on your lot for 1878, but it<span class='line-break'> </span>will be best [?] if you will send at order $1.75 I have sent<span class='line-break'> </span>the order to the Treasurer office, where you can see them if<span class='line-break'> </span>you desire</p>
