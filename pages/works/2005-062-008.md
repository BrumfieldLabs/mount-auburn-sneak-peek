<p>I have examined <span class='line-break'> </span>lots #1 and #1556 and find that <span class='line-break'> </span>about the only way to put them in <span class='line-break'> </span>decent condition is to remove the <span class='line-break'> </span>steps and curb, which are not <span class='line-break'> </span>worth repairing and set plain <span class='line-break'> </span>corner posts.

<p>The price for the care of the <span class='line-break'> </span>four lots about which you ask, <span class='line-break'> </span>#922, 923, 924 and 925, would be <span class='line-break'> </span>$3 for any one lot, or if all are <span class='line-break'> </span>taken $10.00, and the price for <span class='line-break'> </span>top dressing would be $2.00 for any one <span class='line-break'> </span>lot, or $6.00 for all four.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I enclose your estimate<span class='line-break'> </span>of stone curbing to finish your<span class='line-break'> </span>tomb $120 for the stones and $2.<sup>40</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>for the inscription.

To sesod<span class='line-break'> </span>the banks on each side of the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>as proposed would cost from $40<span class='line-break'> </span>to $50 as the sods if once taken<span class='line-break'> </span>off would probably not be good<span class='line-break'> </span>enough to be replaced.</p>
<p>The stone curbing you will have to<span class='line-break'> </span>order direct from the maker, as the Corpo<span class='line-break'></span>ration does not furnish it.

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>I have delayed replying to your <span class='line-break'> </span>note to Mr MacKintosh in order to make careful in<span class='line-break'></span>quiry about the lot, and I can find no reason to think <span class='line-break'> </span>that either bulbs or myrtle have been removed from your <span class='line-break'> </span>lot.</p>
<p>A large number of tulips hyacinths &amp; crocuses were <span class='line-break'> </span>planted on the ornamental grounds near the front gate <span class='line-break'> </span>last fall, which shared the fate of yours and I satis<span class='line-break'></span>fied myself perfectly that they were destroyed by the <span class='line-break'> </span>squirrels.</p>
<p>As to the myrtle, all which is ordered, is raised at <span class='line-break'> </span>our greenhouses outside of the grounds, where we can <span class='line-break'> </span>get all the slips which we need. Early in the spring <span class='line-break'> </span>the myrtle is trimmed with shears to cut out the old wood<span class='line-break'> </span>but it soon fills up again and does all the better for <span class='line-break'> </span>the cutting. This may be what you refer to, but this is done <span class='line-break'> </span>solely for the good of the plants, and the cuttings are <ins> never </ins> <span class='line-break'> </span>used for slips. I regret that anything has happened about <span class='line-break'> </span>your lot to annoy you &amp; will certainly do all I can to prevent <span class='line-break'> </span>any further annoyance.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your letter of Sept<span class='line-break'> </span>30<sup>th</sup> I would say that in May last the key of the<span class='line-break'> </span>tomb was placed in our hands for the purpose of<span class='line-break'> </span>making some repairs on the tomb according to the instruc<span class='line-break'></span>tions of Miss H.N.

<p>The key was not called for until some considerable<span class='line-break'> </span>time had elapsed, after it was sent in &amp; when the<span class='line-break'> </span>interment was ordered the message was sent out per telephone<span class='line-break'> </span>that the key was here, to which I replied that the key had<span class='line-break'> </span>been sent in to Boston according to instructions.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favor received.

<p>In regard to the myrtle one hundred and twenty<span class='line-break'> </span>five and often more plants are used on a single<span class='line-break'> </span>grave.

<p>I enclose you a plan of lot #449, showing the <span class='line-break'> </span>position of the monuments &amp; the graves as far as<span class='line-break'> </span>can be seen. The position of the graves in front<span class='line-break'> </span>of the monument would seem to interfere<span class='line-break'> </span>with the entrance somewhat.</p>
<p>Owing to a drain pipe the position of the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot cannot be changed, and I find I can<span class='line-break'> </span>make a wide gradual slope to the borders<span class='line-break'> </span>by changing the path line, so as to give 4 feet<span class='line-break'> </span>from the <u>inside</u> of the curbing to the edge<span class='line-break'> </span>of path.

<p>The lot slopes from back to front 4 inches,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the rise from the path to the lot, at the<span class='line-break'> </span>Center of lot, is 18 inches and at the corner<span class='line-break'> </span>posts (A&amp;B on plan) 6 inches: I have raised the<span class='line-break'> </span>path to favor the banks in front of your lot as<span class='line-break'> </span>much as was possible without damaging the</p>

<p>other lots. The water can be taken care of by<span class='line-break'> </span>putting some loose stone in the path, and by<span class='line-break'> </span>arranging the gutters &amp; path now there, so that<span class='line-break'> </span>as far as possible it will flow elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have given you a good front line to the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot which it will be easy to fit, instead of<span class='line-break'> </span>the several broken lines now there.</p>
<p>I have marked the proper dimensions on the<span class='line-break'> </span>plan you left with me in <u>red ink</u>.</p>
<p>You will see still for that if you decide<span class='line-break'> </span>to put in a curb which is raised from the ground,<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole amount of rise for the edge if at center<span class='line-break'> </span>will be <u>18 inches</u>, and if where the present gates<span class='line-break'> </span>are, <u>12 inches</u>.</p>

<p>The bill sent you for "care &amp; plants"<span class='line-break'> </span>$7.50 should have read plants $4<u>50</u><span class='line-break'> </span>and top dressing with manure 2.00 instead<span class='line-break'> </span>6<sup>50</sup>; I have placed the differences<span class='line-break'> </span>to your credit.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In reply to your<span class='line-break'> </span>note about the Charge for Myrtle<span class='line-break'> </span>on lot #2364, I would say that<span class='line-break'> </span>you are charged the usual price,<span class='line-break'> </span>and that for the last five years<span class='line-break'> </span>no smaller price has ever been<span class='line-break'> </span>charged for a single grave.</p>
<p>When Myrtle was put on your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot before, it was put on three<span class='line-break'> </span>graves at <u>once</u> and in those<span class='line-break'> </span>cases a small reduction is made,<span class='line-break'> </span>as it costs us less to do the work.</p>
<p>Hoping that this will explain<span class='line-break'> </span>the difference in the charges.</p>
<p>Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>To enclose your lot with<span class='line-break'> </span>posts and chain will require, I find, 30 feet of enclosure<span class='line-break'> </span>on the front side on Indian Ridge Path, and if only<span class='line-break'> </span>the more level land is enclosed, 20 feet on the North side<span class='line-break'> </span>and 10 feet on the South side, making in all 60 feet.</p>
<p>I should place the posts every ten feet, and leave<span class='line-break'> </span>an entrance on Indian Ridge Path. In each of these<span class='line-break'> </span>posts would be upright iron rods from which the<span class='line-break'> </span>chain would be suspended. The cost of the whole<span class='line-break'> </span>including painting, and a woodbases at each post<span class='line-break'> </span>would be $35<sup>00</sup>.</p>

<p>J.O. Wetherbee Esq</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have looked at your lot this morning<span class='line-break'> </span>with reference to the path proposed.</p>
<p>If the grade of your lot is the same as that of the Charter<span class='line-break'> </span>lot, as proposed in your letter, there would only be room<span class='line-break'> </span>back of the lot for a path 15" or 18" wide without interfering<span class='line-break'> </span>with the bank of the lot behind yours which is as steep<span class='line-break'> </span>now as it should be.</p>
<p>If the grade is raised to Conform with that of the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>lot on the path side, there would be a better opportunity<span class='line-break'> </span>but steps would be needed both at Cedar Ave and<span class='line-break'> </span>also at the S.E. corner of your lot next to the Charter<span class='line-break'> </span>lot.</p>
<p>There is also a spruce tree which must be cut at the<span class='line-break'> </span>corner of the Charter lot which can in no way injure<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot, and which I have reason to believe they care<span class='line-break'> </span>much about keeping.</p>
<p>I hope you will be willing to modify your plan<span class='line-break'> </span>[so] that the path will not be an important part. If<span class='line-break'> </span>[you] feel that it is, I will meet you at the lot &amp; will see<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>Miss M.S. Shattuck</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>On the receipt of your note of the<span class='line-break'> </span>24<sup>th</sup> Sept. I went to your lot to examine its con<span class='line-break'></span>dition. I find that the soil is poor and that the shade<span class='line-break'> </span>from the two large trees added to that of the fence and<span class='line-break'> </span>headstones is too much altogether for good grass. The<span class='line-break'> </span>roots of the tree are all through the lot, and draw<span class='line-break'> </span>out the nourishment before the grass &amp; myrtle can get it.<span class='line-break'> </span>By digging the lot now, removing the roots and putting<span class='line-break'> </span>in plenty of good soil, the lot would be put in good<span class='line-break'> </span>order for a while, but the roots would soon fill it up<span class='line-break'> </span>again &amp; then the grass &amp; myrtle would grow poor. As this<span class='line-break'> </span>would be a large expense, I should not advise it, if you<span class='line-break'> </span>are willing to wait for the grass seed that has been<span class='line-break'> </span>put in to grow. This requires frequent rain. The lot<span class='line-break'> </span>has been seeded twice, but the season has been a <span class='line-break'> </span>particularly hard one on account of the great dryness.</p>
<p>On the Baxter lot a much larger amount of money<span class='line-break'> </span>has been expended, the lot having been resodded several<span class='line-break'> </span>times, and being free from very much shade, so that it<span class='line-break'> </span>ought to look better.

<p>grass there was to cut, have weeded, &amp; watered &amp; seeded<span class='line-break'> </span>it as often as on the other lots, and I believe its poor<span class='line-break'> </span>condition is solely due to the reasons which I have<span class='line-break'> </span>given you, and that while a larger expenditure of money<span class='line-break'> </span>would improve the lot, it would not bring it to as good<span class='line-break'> </span>condition as the Baxter lot, while there is as much<span class='line-break'> </span>shade &amp; as many roots in the lot to take the<span class='line-break'> </span>nourishment from the soil.</p>

<p>He followed your instructions as he understood<span class='line-break'> </span>them, and on account of the number of plants you<span class='line-break'> </span>were charged less than the price specified in the order.</p>

If you<span class='line-break'> </span>do not feel satisfied about it, the Treasurer<span class='line-break'> </span>will make you such a discount on payment<span class='line-break'> </span>of the bill as will be satisfactory, as I prefer to<span class='line-break'> </span>make a loss on the work, &amp; have the bill satisfactory.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>The foundations about <span class='line-break'> </span>which you asked at the office yesterday are placed<span class='line-break'> </span>exactly at the heads of the graves.</p>
<p>There is not room for another burial between the<span class='line-break'> </span>graves George Kittredge and the child's graves.</p>
<p>Probably a little more space can be made, if<span class='line-break'> </span>it is absolutely necessary to use that spot, by moving<span class='line-break'> </span>the brick grave where the child is buried as far as<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot extends, which <u>might</u> give room for another<span class='line-break'> </span>burial between tho' this is not certain.</p>
<p>Sometimes the catacombs are made deep enough <span class='line-break'> </span>for two burials, one above the other, separated by a <span class='line-break'> </span><del>brick</del> <sup>slate </sup>shelf. A catacomb of this sort could be built<span class='line-break'> </span>and the remains of George Kittredge placed in the<span class='line-break'> </span>lower portion, or that grave could be left and the same<span class='line-break'> </span>thing done with the child's remains. The foundations could<span class='line-break'> </span>be made continuous and the stones placed side<span class='line-break'> </span>by side.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>About the 19<sup>th</sup> April 1880 you<span class='line-break'> </span>sent an order for "Care of lot including rose bushes 3<sup>00</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>and top dressing $2<sup>00</sup>.

<p>In June a note was received with directions to plant<span class='line-break'> </span>bush lobelia all over the grave of W<sup>m</sup> D. Powell, and <span class='line-break'> </span>for this a charge of $3<sup>50</sup> was made. By mistake the<span class='line-break'> </span>charges were not sent all together as was intended.</p>
<p>I hope this will satisfactorily explain the matter.</p>
<p>Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>
<p>Will you please advise me, if you desire the lobelia<span class='line-break'> </span>planted this year in the same way as last.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>The snow<span class='line-break'> </span>has now so far disappeared as to<span class='line-break'> </span>enable me to see what could<span class='line-break'> </span>be added to your lot. I find <span class='line-break'> </span>that a strip 7 feet deep could be<span class='line-break'> </span>added on the back, which would<span class='line-break'> </span>allow of one more row of burials<span class='line-break'> </span>across the lot, and that land<span class='line-break'> </span>enough could be added on the<span class='line-break'> </span>North side (say a strip 2<sup>1</sup>/2 feet wide<span class='line-break'> </span>to make three additional burials).</p>
<p>In order to do this, it will be necessary<span class='line-break'> </span>to remove the fence and leave four<span class='line-break'> </span>granite posts at the corners, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>grade of the lot would have to be<span class='line-break'> </span>lowered somewhat, but the graves<span class='line-break'> </span>now in the lot need not be disturbed.</p>
<p>The expense of the addition and of<span class='line-break'> </span>putting the lot in order, that is<span class='line-break'> </span>removing the fence, leaving a good<span class='line-break'> </span>granite post at each corner, regrading<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot &amp; sodding, would be two<span class='line-break'> </span>hundred and fifty dollars, and you<span class='line-break'> </span>would be able to make at least<span class='line-break'> </span>eight more burials in the lot.</p>

<p>Your letter. The deterioration of lot #3566<span class='line-break'> </span>is mainly due to the tree of which I spoke in my former<span class='line-break'> </span>letter.

<p>Your note received. -- I<span class='line-break'> </span>have already written Miss S.V. Cunningham So Boston about<span class='line-break'> </span>lot #477.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>To lower the posts to show <span class='line-break'> </span>6 inches less (or more if you desire) <span class='line-break'> </span>and to take out the step and <span class='line-break'> </span>recut the front and make it <span class='line-break'> </span>thinner so as to conform as <span class='line-break'> </span>nearly as possible to the grade <span class='line-break'> </span>of sod will cost $20 not including <span class='line-break'> </span>the number. To cut the number <span class='line-break'> </span>in raised letters as new would <span class='line-break'> </span>cost $6, but it could be cut for <span class='line-break'> </span>$3 or less if cut in sunk letters as <span class='line-break'> </span>on the lot opposite which you looked <span class='line-break'> </span>at.</p>
<p>This includes the replacing of the sod <span class='line-break'> </span>around the posts &amp; steps which I <span class='line-break'> </span>will keep in order for a year <span class='line-break'> </span>provided you give us the care <span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot for 1882 at the usual <span class='line-break'> </span>rates.</p>
<p>I think there is no question <span class='line-break'> </span>that this is the best way to <span class='line-break'> </span>fix the lot. A change of grade <span class='line-break'> </span>would be bad beside which <span class='line-break'> </span>it would cost more.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Your letter is received. <span class='line-break'> </span>The usual charge for a myrtle grave is $7 the work <span class='line-break'> </span>and care being $3 and the myrtle $4. You ordered <span class='line-break'> </span>3 myrtle graves and the gardener reported that you had <span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle for half a grave. You were therfore credited <span class='line-break'> </span>with $2, the charge on the bill being $19 instead of <span class='line-break'> </span>$21, the price of 3 full graves.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to your inquiry as to lot 3665 - Eaton<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot is not in such condition as to need sodding. I think<span class='line-break'> </span>if the long grass were cut down, top dressing put on and the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot taken care of next year the grass would come up<span class='line-break'> </span>all right. It would cost $1 to cut the grass and clean<span class='line-break'> </span>up the lot this fall before top dressing and the other charges<span class='line-break'> </span>at the usual rates.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I send you by mail<span class='line-break'> </span>plans of two different tombs: one of<span class='line-break'> </span>them would be built entirely underground<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; the entrance of which could be covered<span class='line-break'> </span>by the sod or not as desired &amp; could be<span class='line-break'> </span>built either into the hillside near<span class='line-break'> </span>the lake, or on a more level spot.</p>
<p>The other plan would necessarily be<span class='line-break'> </span>built into the hill side &amp; would have<span class='line-break'> </span>a part of cut stone, and if the exact<span class='line-break'> </span>detail of the plan which I send were<span class='line-break'> </span>followed, a larger lot would be<span class='line-break'> </span>needed, but the plan could be altered<span class='line-break'> </span>in this respect.</p>
<p>The plan described first is marked (A)<span class='line-break'> </span>this has a flight of brick steps from the ground<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; has 7 compartments on either side of the<span class='line-break'> </span>steps; the walls &amp; arch are of brick &amp; the<span class='line-break'> </span>part of the catacomb &amp; doors of slate or marble<span class='line-break'> </span>floor, either cemented or tiled. The expense<span class='line-break'> </span>of a tomb of this kind would be from<span class='line-break'> </span>$1000 to $2000  according to the amount of<span class='line-break'> </span>marble, tiles &amp;c. used in the finish.<span class='line-break'> </span>A tomb of the plan marked B of the<span class='line-break'> </span>same size with marble in front of Catacomb<span class='line-break'> </span>and ^<sup>cut</sup> stone front &amp; marble entrance, tiled<span class='line-break'> </span>floor &amp;c would cost from $3000 to $5000.</p>
<p>A lot of 300 ft. in the hillside opposite<span class='line-break'> </span>the lake would cost $675 and a<span class='line-break'> </span>larger lot in proportion. The lot near 4541<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $660.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The land about<span class='line-break'> </span>which you inquire yesterday, has<span class='line-break'> </span>not been offered for sale in lots<span class='line-break'> </span>as it is desirable to keep some open<span class='line-break'> </span>land near the front entrance and<span class='line-break'> </span>as a drain passes across it some 9 or<span class='line-break'> </span>10 feet below the surface, as shown<span class='line-break'> </span>by the enclosed plan on which a new<span class='line-break'> </span>lot has been laid out, next to that<span class='line-break'> </span>last sold (no #3891). This new lot (not <span class='line-break'> </span>numbered on plan) contains 300 sq.<span class='line-break'> </span>ft.</p>
<p>If this lot were sold at all, it would<span class='line-break'> </span>be with the understanding that no<span class='line-break'> </span>stonework other than monuments, headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>or the corner posts set by the Corporation to<span class='line-break'> </span>mark the lot, be placed there.</p>
<p>The drain is very substantialy built<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; covered with heavy stone &amp; would<span class='line-break'> </span>be several feet below any burial<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; would I believe do no damage to<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot, but I should want you<span class='line-break'> </span>if you bought the lot to understand that<span class='line-break'> </span>there was a drain there.</p>
<p>The price of the lot, marked with the<span class='line-break'> </span>corner posts as set by the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>and with the turfing under perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care would be $1500.</p>
<p>There are numerous lots in other parts<span class='line-break'> </span>of the cemetery which as lots, are quite<span class='line-break'> </span>as desirable, which I could sell you<span class='line-break'> </span>for considerably less.</p>

The granite is also very much out of place to<span class='line-break'> </span>reset and relead that and secure it with clamps as it ought<span class='line-break'> </span>to be would cost $25.</p>
<p>The gardener thinks a cut leaved maple or double flowering<span class='line-break'> </span>horse chestnut tree would be suitable, the maple being best<span class='line-break'> </span>as the chestnut will stain the stone near it. Either of<span class='line-break'> </span>them about 12 ft high will cost you $8, we to replace it<span class='line-break'> </span>if it fails to grow.</p>

<p>It will cost $11 to properly scrape<span class='line-break'> </span>and paint the fence and repair the gate of lots<span class='line-break'> </span>#862 &amp; #863.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your note received. I think you<span class='line-break'> </span>have done sufficient work in Mt Auburn to know<span class='line-break'> </span>that our rule is that foundations must go to the<span class='line-break'> </span>bottom of the grave. There have been so many<span class='line-break'> </span>cases of caving that a foundation that does not<span class='line-break'> </span>go so deep is of no practical use. If you had left<span class='line-break'> </span>the root of those stones as deep as the foundations should<span class='line-break'> </span>be there would have been no trouble. Knowing our<span class='line-break'> </span>rules as to foundations it seems to me you could have<span class='line-break'> </span>included that in you estimate or if you had any<span class='line-break'> </span>doubt about it you could have asked the cost before hand<span class='line-break'> </span>as stonecutters repeatedly do.</p>

<p>My estimate for<span class='line-break'> </span>repairing the curbing around your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot (No 3337 Laurel Ave is as<span class='line-break'> </span>follows.<span class='line-break'> </span><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>14 iron clamps galvanized</th> <th>$3.50<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>6 days masons &amp; cutting &amp; clamp'g</td> <td>18.00</td> </tr> <tr><td>1 <sup>1</sup>/3 [days] leading joints</td> <td>4.00</td> </tr> <tr><td>50 lts lead</td> <td>3.50</td> </tr> <tr><td>1 <sup>1</sup>/2 labor sodding, borders &amp; next curb'g</td> <td>3.37</td> </tr> <tr><td>120 ft sods</td> <td>3.60</td> </tr> <tr><td>[Total]</td> <td>$35.97</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The cost of a stone post if wanted<span class='line-break'> </span>for the vase you propose to place on the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot would be $3.50 to $5.00 set, according<span class='line-break'> </span>to whether a post 10" square would answer,<span class='line-break'> </span>or whether a larger one must be put there<span class='line-break'> </span>say 12 inches square, which is probably as<span class='line-break'> </span>large as any I now have on hand.</p>
<p>The open joint could be filled with<span class='line-break'> </span>lead at a smaller expense, but the<span class='line-break'> </span>curb unless clamped &amp; reset would<span class='line-break'> </span>continue to move with each winter's frost<span class='line-break'> </span>so that while the first cost would be<span class='line-break'> </span>less, it would in my opinion be poor<span class='line-break'> </span>economy to repair in that way.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to your<span class='line-break'> </span>note, would say that the Tillson lot<span class='line-break'> </span>is #2972 and that the grade is 19<span class='line-break'> </span>inches above the avenue. From the line<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot to the avenue is 6 ft 8 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>and the buttresses or end posts, should<span class='line-break'> </span>not project beyond this. The corner post of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot can of course, as usual, set<span class='line-break'> </span>12 inches outside of lot lines.</p>
<p>To take up the posts now on lots<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $6.<sup>00</sup> and to set corner<span class='line-break'> </span>posts &amp; entrance like the Holt lot $30.<sup>00</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>No sodding is included in the estimate<span class='line-break'> </span>as the lot will I think to look<span class='line-break'> </span>really well require resodding after<span class='line-break'> </span>the stone work is complete.</p>
<p>I wrote you about Donner's lot<span class='line-break'> </span>some time ago. The distance from the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot line to the avenue line is 6'-6"- and<span class='line-break'> </span>at the center of the lot there is only 6 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>rise above avenue.

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Your note with<span class='line-break'> </span>reference to lot #1943 has been received<span class='line-break'> </span>and shall have prompt attention.</p>
<p>The graves in the rear of the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>have settled very considerably and<span class='line-break'> </span>of course the myrtle has settled with<span class='line-break'> </span>them. This generally occurs after a time<span class='line-break'> </span>unless the burials are made in brick<span class='line-break'> </span>vaults, and the only way to do will be<span class='line-break'> </span>to take up all the myrtle &amp; fill in<span class='line-break'> </span>considerable earth &amp; then replant<span class='line-break'> </span>the myrtle. As the myrtle will not look<span class='line-break'> </span>as well after replanting, until it<span class='line-break'> </span>has had time to make some new<span class='line-break'> </span>growth. I would like to hear form<span class='line-break'> </span>you before doing anything, as you<span class='line-break'> </span>may prefer not to have this done<span class='line-break'> </span>at present.</p>
<p>One of the headstones has settled<span class='line-break'> </span>too, and should be reset. There does<span class='line-break'> </span>not appear to be any foundations<span class='line-break'> </span>under it.</p>
<p>The whole cost of raising the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>in the back, &amp; resetting the myrtle &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>raising the headstone &amp; putting a foun<span class='line-break'></span>dation under it would be $10.<sup>00</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>It may be that a foundation will<span class='line-break'> </span>not be needed, which would reduce<span class='line-break'> </span>the expense some four dollars, but this<span class='line-break'> </span>can be seen better when the stone is<span class='line-break'> </span>reset. This work can be done next week<span class='line-break'> </span>if you will advise us promptly.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I think that<span class='line-break'> </span>the hemlock tree on the corner of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Wyman lot next to yours would<span class='line-break'> </span>have to be removed to do much<span class='line-break'> </span>good.</p>
<p>I think I wrote you before that<span class='line-break'> </span>in my opinion the drip from the<span class='line-break'> </span>vines did quite as much harm<span class='line-break'> </span>as the tree, but tho' you wrote me<span class='line-break'> </span>I might trim them considerably. I<span class='line-break'> </span>thought when the vines were out more,<span class='line-break'> </span>it could be better seen how much<span class='line-break'> </span>harm they did.</p>
<p>Perhaps your best way could be<span class='line-break'> </span>to have the gardener go to a lot<span class='line-break'> </span>with you &amp; trim while you were<span class='line-break'> </span>set what would be better removed<span class='line-break'> </span>or if you leave it to us, I<span class='line-break'> </span>will have it attended to<span class='line-break'> </span>as judisciously as possible</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>I have carefully ex<span class='line-break'></span>amined your lot with reference to<span class='line-break'> </span>the change of grade which you spoke<span class='line-break'> </span>to me about, and while I would<span class='line-break'> </span>much prefer to have no change<span class='line-break'> </span>made, still if you find the present<span class='line-break'> </span>grade so unsatisfactory to you, and<span class='line-break'> </span>are disposed to go to so large an<span class='line-break'> </span>expense, it might perhaps be arranged.</p>
<p>I doubt if the general appearance would<span class='line-break'> </span>be improved by the change, and it<span class='line-break'> </span>does not seem to me that any improve<span class='line-break'></span>ment which you would devise from it,<span class='line-break'> </span>would warrant so large an expense.</p>
<p>The reason of the great expense about<span class='line-break'> </span>the change is that the embankment<span class='line-break'> </span>would have to be formed again<span class='line-break'> </span>from the bottom in order to have<span class='line-break'> </span>the grade of the bank regular</p>

<p>I do not know what the cost of<span class='line-break'> </span>moving the monument &amp; remains from<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston would be, probably not a<span class='line-break'> </span>great dea.

<p>The fence would only ask as old<span class='line-break'> </span>since having been a long time without<span class='line-break'> </span>care.</p>

<p>The oak tree is probably the source<span class='line-break'> </span>of nearly all of the discoloration to<span class='line-break'> </span>the marble, and if you complete<span class='line-break'> </span>the contract for the perpetual care of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot an estimate for which has<span class='line-break'> </span>first been sent, there need be no<span class='line-break'> </span>difficulty about having the marble<span class='line-break'> </span>kept clean and I think in a condition<span class='line-break'> </span>which would be satisfactory to you.</p>

<p>There is no use of top dressing or<span class='line-break'> </span>caring for the lot unless it is returfed.<span class='line-break'> </span>There is nothing there now but weeds</p>
<p>To regrade and resod will cost $40.<span class='line-break'> </span>This will leave the lot all in good order.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>I have examined into<span class='line-break'> </span>the matter of your order for care of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Emmons lot #852 and find that<span class='line-break'> </span>on May 12th [18]80 you gave a signed order<span class='line-break'> </span>to the gardener which reads "Care of lot until<span class='line-break'> </span>counter manded." And in accordance with<span class='line-break'> </span>it the lot was cared for 1880 &amp; 81 as attested<span class='line-break'> </span>by the returns from the foreman and<span class='line-break'> </span>workman. I see no reason why the bill<span class='line-break'> </span>should not be paid. The order is on file at<span class='line-break'> </span>this office &amp; can be seen by you at anytime.</p>
<p>The foreman reports that no grave enclosure has been<span class='line-break'> </span>removed from the lot to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Mrs L.B. Ryder<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In regard to the<span class='line-break'> </span>mistake in opening grave this after<span class='line-break'></span>-noon. Your letter ordered it dug "<u>to the<span class='line-break'> </span>right of the grave of Cora towards the <span class='line-break'> </span>gate</u>". Whether you referred to the gate<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot or the gate of the Cemetery that<span class='line-break'> </span>would not describe the location where<span class='line-break'> </span>grave now is.  Last night I<span class='line-break'> </span>telephoned Mr Litchfield that the descrip<span class='line-break'></span>-tion was not clear and he called and<span class='line-break'> </span>agreed with me that as near as<span class='line-break'> </span>could be judged by your letter the location<span class='line-break'> </span>was where the first grave was opened.</p>
<p>It was agreed however to prevent mistakes<span class='line-break'> </span>that no work should be done until<span class='line-break'> </span>10 a.m today, that I claim gave ample<span class='line-break'> </span>time to communicate with you or some<span class='line-break'> </span>member of your family and have the<span class='line-break'> </span>matter put right. I held the men in<span class='line-break'> </span>attendance waiting for other instructions. I<span class='line-break'> </span>do not desire to render a bill for that and<span class='line-break'> </span>the extra work but think it just to point<span class='line-break'> </span>out to you that the mistake does not<span class='line-break'> </span>lie with any servant of this Corporation.</p>

<p>In answer to<span class='line-break'> </span>your favor of yesterday I would<span class='line-break'> </span>say that as the tree so not<span class='line-break'> </span>within your lot.

<p>In my judgment the headstones are<span class='line-break'> </span>soiled as much by some of the trees<span class='line-break'> </span>which are more distant as by the<span class='line-break'> </span>one which immediately overhangs and<span class='line-break'> </span>I find it necessary to have the<span class='line-break'> </span>headstones on lots which are under<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care cleaned frequently<span class='line-break'> </span>even when there are no trees near.</p>
<p>In regard to the price of a<span class='line-break'> </span>foundation for a double tablet,<span class='line-break'> </span>before I can speak at all definitely<span class='line-break'> </span>I must know the size of the base stone<span class='line-break'> </span>of the headstone.

In regard to the grade<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot could not be raised to a level<span class='line-break'> </span>with lot #2038 (North) but it might be<span class='line-break'> </span>raised about a foot on the side next that lot<span class='line-break'> </span>and six inches on the south side but not<span class='line-break'> </span>more and the addition to the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>would only be sold with this under<span class='line-break'></span>-standing. This would make some<span class='line-break'> </span>slope from side to side but it would<span class='line-break'> </span>not show very much and the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>would probably look much better than <span class='line-break'> </span>now.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to your order to<span class='line-break'> </span>grade and sod the Nash lot #1821, I find<span class='line-break'> </span>there is a bill for work done on this<span class='line-break'> </span>lot charged to Mrs F K.

I am directed by vote<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Trustees to do no work on lots<span class='line-break'> </span>where there are unpaid bills. Will<span class='line-break'> </span>you therefore please give the matter your<span class='line-break'> </span>attention so that the work of grading<span class='line-break'> </span>may be done.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your postal card was received.<span class='line-break'> </span>I have examined lot 1224 and<span class='line-break'> </span>would suggest that you remove the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence. The old material will pay<span class='line-break'> </span>for removal, filling up old post holes,<span class='line-break'> </span>cutting over 4 posts for corners and cutting<span class='line-break'> </span>the number of lot on one of them.</p>
<p>The lot should be regraded and<span class='line-break'> </span>sodded. That would cost $40.</p>

<p>I have examined lot <span class='line-break'> </span>1213 and estimate it will cost $6<sup>50</sup>/100<span class='line-break'> </span>to mound the 5 graves in it. The<span class='line-break'> </span>fence is in very poor condition. I<span class='line-break'> </span>would advise its removal.

<p>Enclosed please find<span class='line-break'> </span>bill as desired.

<p>In answer to your<span class='line-break'> </span>favor of the 9<sup>th</sup>, I will say that<span class='line-break'> </span>as the circumstances seem somewhat<span class='line-break'> </span>exceptional, I will try to arrange<span class='line-break'> </span>the payment to meet your views tho'<span class='line-break'> </span>it is usually made according to<span class='line-break'> </span>the terms of the certificate sent<span class='line-break'> </span>you.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to<span class='line-break'> </span>your note, I would say that no<span class='line-break'> </span>stonework can be placed around<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot you selected and that<span class='line-break'> </span>but few enclosures of any kind are<span class='line-break'> </span>now erected.</p>
<p>At no quorum of Trustees was<span class='line-break'> </span>present at the meeting called for<span class='line-break'> </span>Wednesday, no action of any kind<span class='line-break'> </span>was taken in regard to a fountain<span class='line-break'> </span>or water, tho' I mentioned the subject<span class='line-break'> </span>to several of the gentlemen present.</p>
<p>I have ascertained that the only way<span class='line-break'> </span>in which good water can be procured<span class='line-break'> </span>would be to lay a pipe from close by<span class='line-break'> </span>our front gate to your lot, which<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $500. and that the<span class='line-break'> </span>water could be obtained from the<span class='line-break'> </span>City for 2 cents per 100 gallons.</p>
<p>You were going as I understood it<span class='line-break'> </span>to send a written petition in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>to the name "Band of Mercy" after con<span class='line-break'></span>sidering the matter, as I take you that<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees must act on any<span class='line-break'> </span>changes of name.</p>
<p>There will probably be a meeting<span class='line-break'> </span>called before long, &amp; perhaps it would<span class='line-break'> </span>be well to send me a written<span class='line-break'> </span>statement to lay before the Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>of your exact wishes in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Fountain, water supply<span class='line-break'> </span>name of path &amp;c, which would<span class='line-break'> </span>be more definite than anything</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In answer to your<span class='line-break'> </span>note to M<sup>r</sup> Collins with reference<span class='line-break'> </span>to the condition of lot #1158 (Prince)<span class='line-break'> </span>I would say that no order has been<span class='line-break'> </span>given for care and repair on this<span class='line-break'> </span>lot for more than four or five years.</p>
<p>The grass can be kept cut by<span class='line-break'> </span>your sending an annual or a permanent<span class='line-break'> </span>order in writing to that effect, and<span class='line-break'> </span>such other repairs as may be desired<span class='line-break'> </span>from time to time will be made when<span class='line-break'> </span>ordered; or you can make a permanent<span class='line-break'> </span>arrangement for care and repair according<span class='line-break'> </span>to the circular enclosed.</p>
<p>In regard to the Rufus Choate lot<span class='line-break'> </span>the orders received were for the cutting<span class='line-break'> </span>of the grass, the trimming of the vines &amp; the<span class='line-break'> </span>enriching of the sod (the latter to be done<span class='line-break'> </span>this fall)</p>
<p>This is the first year the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>has cared for the lot and I do not<span class='line-break'> </span>know how well it may have looked<span class='line-break'> </span>in past years, but it is in much<span class='line-break'> </span>better order than when taken in the<span class='line-break'> </span>spring.</p>
<p>There are four trees in the lot, besides<span class='line-break'> </span>several near, which give too much<span class='line-break'> </span>shade for good grass.</p>
<p>The removal of all or a part of the<span class='line-break'> </span>trees in the lot &amp; the painting of the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence would improve the lot as<span class='line-break'> </span>would resodding, but it is of no use to<span class='line-break'> </span>go to the expense of resodding with so much shade.<span class='line-break'> </span>Any instructions you may send will be promptly attended to</p>

<p>The only satisfactory<span class='line-break'> </span>way to repair the steps on the Grant<span class='line-break'> </span>lot is to lower them about 8 inches.<span class='line-break'> </span>To do this the fence would have to be<span class='line-break'> </span>removed and the grade changed.<span class='line-break'> </span>The old material of the fence<span class='line-break'> </span>would pay for the work.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your note in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>to the charge for myrtle is received.</p>
<p>From your order filed in this office I<span class='line-break'> </span>find you gave directions to prepare<span class='line-break'> </span>a grave for myrtle at our usual charge<span class='line-break'> </span>of $3.

<p>The gardener states that all the myrtle<span class='line-break'> </span>was planted on the grave prepared<span class='line-break'> </span>and that you sent only sufficient for<span class='line-break'> </span>that.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In ansewr to your favor as<span class='line-break'> </span>of the 11<sup>th</sup> inst. I would say that the distance<span class='line-break'> </span>from the present back line of the inner<span class='line-break'> </span>curbing, to the headstones is 11 to 12 inches &amp; that<span class='line-break'> </span>the width of the bases of the headstones is 17 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>making from lot line to the front of the bases<span class='line-break'> </span>of headstones 2'-4" or 5". Ordinarily, the proprietors<span class='line-break'> </span>of lots here own only the land enclosed in<span class='line-break'> </span>the <u>inner</u> enclosure: with a right of passage<span class='line-break'> </span>from the Avenue, only, but in this case the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot was originally laid out differently,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the shape was altered when the<span class='line-break'> </span>present curbing was put up. M<sup>r</sup> Fiske's<span class='line-break'> </span>deed calls for five hundred feet, but<span class='line-break'> </span>there is at present enclosed about 418 ft.<span class='line-break'> </span>leaving 82 ft not included in the inner<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosure which belongs to him.</p>
<p>If he prefers to place the monument<span class='line-break'> </span>at the head of the graves, as the headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>now stand, I think it might be arranged<span class='line-break'> </span>as that he could occupy land back of<span class='line-break'> </span>his present line &amp; then make up the 82 ft<span class='line-break'> </span>which belong to him, tho' it does not seem<span class='line-break'> </span>as if he could go back as much as 3'-4"<span class='line-break'> </span>which would be needed to make up the<span class='line-break'> </span>width of the foundation in addition to the land<span class='line-break'> </span>now between the line &amp; the front of the headstone<span class='line-break'> </span>bases, without interfering with the next lots,<span class='line-break'> </span>but he might go back enough to answer the<span class='line-break'> </span>purpose. If the owner of the next lot should<span class='line-break'> </span>ever put up a stone line, which by his deed<span class='line-break'> </span>he has the right to do, the monument would,<span class='line-break'> </span>if seems to me, come very near to it. &amp; look too<span class='line-break'> </span>crowded, perhaps.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to your<span class='line-break'> </span>request through the Treasurer for<span class='line-break'> </span>the items of the bill of $69 on the<span class='line-break'> </span>Loving lot #4724. The charge for<span class='line-break'> </span>ordinary interments including the<span class='line-break'> </span>extra records would be $18. The<span class='line-break'> </span>balance $51 is the charge for<span class='line-break'> </span>Mason work both of brick graves and<span class='line-break'> </span>foundation. They being built together the<span class='line-break'> </span>charge is less than it otherwise would be.</p>
<p>If built separately the charge for foundation<span class='line-break'> </span>would be $15 <sup>40</sup>/100</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The Treasurer has forwarded<span class='line-break'> </span>me yours of the 14<sup>th</sup> inst for reply.</p>
<p>The bill of $6<sup>50</sup> which you paid for<span class='line-break'> </span>lot #2147 on Oct 30<sup>th</sup> paid for the care of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot which consists in keeping the grass<span class='line-break'> </span>cut &amp; the lot raked off &amp; clean, and for<span class='line-break'> </span>top dressing with manure.</p>
<p>In making any arrangement for the per<span class='line-break'></span>petual care of the lot, it would be<span class='line-break'> </span>better to arrange if possible for the care<span class='line-break'> </span>of the three lots in the enclosure. This<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost including the painting of<span class='line-break'> </span>the fence &amp; the cleaning of the headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>$1050.00 or if the renewal of the headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>is included the cost would be $250<span class='line-break'> </span>additional.</p>
<p>If the fence were removed the expense<span class='line-break'> </span>of perpetual care would be one hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>and fifty dollars less.</p>
<p>The cost of perpetual care of your lot<span class='line-break'> </span>#2147 alone, would be including the<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning of the headstones, and the painting<span class='line-break'> </span>of the fences (for as long as the fence on the<span class='line-break'> </span>adjoining lots is kept in order) $450<span class='line-break'> </span>and including the renewal of the headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>$150 additional. If the fence were<span class='line-break'> </span>first removed either estimate would<span class='line-break'> </span>be $75 dollars less.</p>

<p>The custom has been under<span class='line-break'> </span>the restriction which all in all the<span class='line-break'> </span>deeds now given out reserving to the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corp<sup>n</sup> the right to do all work, to<span class='line-break'> </span>permit headstones to be placed<span class='line-break'> </span>on foundations by parties not in the<span class='line-break'> </span>employ of the Corporation, and to<span class='line-break'> </span>permit them in certain cases to erect<span class='line-break'> </span>monuments where they were known<span class='line-break'> </span>to be careful &amp; responsible people.</p>
<p>While they are not likely to do much<span class='line-break'> </span>damage in setting headstones, they<span class='line-break'> </span>may do much in setting monuments<span class='line-break'> </span>which are heavy &amp; I think the best way<span class='line-break'> </span>is to claim our right to set them whenever<span class='line-break'> </span>they are large enough to do damage. For<span class='line-break'> </span>persons who are known to be unusually<span class='line-break'> </span>careful an [exception?] be made<span class='line-break'> </span>when desirable.</p>
<p>Our practice has been to apply the<span class='line-break'> </span>rule to all lots under p.c. which<span class='line-break'> </span><u>includes</u> of course all which are<span class='line-break'> </span>under the present form of deed.</p>
<p>I think under the restrictions in<span class='line-break'> </span>the deeds, all steps, posts or enclosures<span class='line-break'> </span>should be set by our own employees.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am sorry there<span class='line-break'> </span>has been a mistake in regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>mounding the graves in your lot.</p>
<p>The grave in the N.W. corner could<span class='line-break'> </span>not be found. The others were made<span class='line-break'> </span>as large as we usualy make them. No<span class='line-break'> </span>changes can now be made but the<span class='line-break'> </span>matter will be attended to in the spring.</p>
<p>It is not good policy to raise the<span class='line-break'> </span>mounds too high as the sod is<span class='line-break'> </span>scorched in the summer and dies.<span class='line-break'> </span>However it will be done as<span class='line-break'> </span>you desire.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed please<span class='line-break'> </span>find certificate of the additions<span class='line-break'> </span>you spoke to me about yesterday.</p>
<p>The best way to arrange the curbing<span class='line-break'> </span>will be to move the present back<span class='line-break'> </span>corners over to form the new<span class='line-break'> </span>corners on the path side, and then<span class='line-break'> </span>to put in 25 ft of new stone on<span class='line-break'> </span>each side. The present back will<span class='line-break'> </span>answer, when shortened, for the<span class='line-break'> </span>pieces on each side of the entrance<span class='line-break'> </span>running to the corners, if you propose<span class='line-break'> </span>to have a secure entrance, or if<span class='line-break'> </span>not will form the new line<span class='line-break'> </span>parallel with the path.</p>
<p>On each side of the posts at the<span class='line-break'> </span>foot of the buttresses of the present<span class='line-break'> </span>entrance, a piece of stone border<span class='line-break'> </span>runs along the avenue line.</p>
<p>Such pieces are not now put in<span class='line-break'> </span>on either avenue line or path &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>should therefore be omitted in a<span class='line-break'> </span>new entrance.</p>
<p>When you have made arrange<span class='line-break'></span>ments with the parties who are to<span class='line-break'> </span>do this work if they will call or<span class='line-break'> </span>write to the office, should be glad<span class='line-break'> </span>to see their plan that the dimensions<span class='line-break'> </span>of the new lot may be correct, and<span class='line-break'> </span>if you arrange for the delivery on the<span class='line-break'> </span>avenue of the new stone, I can have<span class='line-break'> </span>the balance done here for you.</p>

<p>The bodies now in<span class='line-break'> </span>the tomb on lot #366 can be<span class='line-break'> </span>placed in graves, after the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>has been removed, and the grade<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot can be smoothed off,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the lot resodded. The cost<span class='line-break'> </span>of this would be $55 &amp; the old material<span class='line-break'> </span>in the tomb; this does not include<span class='line-break'> </span>any boxes for the bodies to be removed;<span class='line-break'> </span>if you desire them reboxed in any<span class='line-break'> </span>case an additional charge would<span class='line-break'> </span>be made, and it provides only for<span class='line-break'> </span>burials in the earth, not in brick<span class='line-break'> </span>catacombs, which are sometimes<span class='line-break'> </span>used.</p>
<p>I see no difficulty in making the<span class='line-break'> </span>changes and should consider it<span class='line-break'> </span>desirable.</p>
<p>To provide for the perpetual care of<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot $300 would be sufficient<span class='line-break'> </span>if the tomb is removed and the <span class='line-break'> </span>burials made as proposed above.</p>

<p>Your note is received.<span class='line-break'> </span>The plants were charged at our<span class='line-break'> </span>usual rate of $1.50 per dozen. We set<span class='line-break'> </span>out the plants replace them if they<span class='line-break'> </span>die care for and water them during<span class='line-break'> </span>the season and have therefore to<span class='line-break'> </span>make a higher charge than if <span class='line-break'> </span>our responsibility ended when we hand<span class='line-break'></span>ed you the plants at our greenhouse</p>
<p>I do not know of any florist in this<span class='line-break'> </span>neighbourhood who will set out plants<span class='line-break'> </span>and care for them at a lower<span class='line-break'> </span>charge.</p>
<p>I think $1.50 is a reasonable<span class='line-break'> </span>charge for transplanting the rose<span class='line-break'> </span>etc.  I find by the gardeners ticket<span class='line-break'> </span>that there was used <sup>3</sup>/4 loads loam<span class='line-break'> </span>1 <sup>1</sup>/2 barrows manure and <sup>1</sup>/2 day<span class='line-break'> </span>labor.</p>
<p>I find also that no charge has been<span class='line-break'> </span>made for storing the palm in<span class='line-break'> </span>our greenhouse the usual price<span class='line-break'> </span>for that is $1.50</p>

<p>In reply to yours of<span class='line-break'> </span>the 3<sup>rd</sup> inst addressed to the Sec'y.<span class='line-break'> </span>I would say that the lot owned by the<span class='line-break'> </span>late Tho<sup>s </sup>Denney contains 300 sq feet<span class='line-break'> </span>is enclosed in the same enclosure<span class='line-break'> </span>with the lot owned by the late<span class='line-break'> </span>John Tappan, and that as far as<span class='line-break'> </span>can be ascertained from the sur<span class='line-break'></span>face of the ground eight more burials<span class='line-break'> </span>can be made as shown on the<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosed plan, marked pencil; this<span class='line-break'> </span>being a copy from another plan on<span class='line-break'> </span>which these which could be made<span class='line-break'> </span>hereafter were so drawn on.</p>
<p>The amount needed for the<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care of the lot would be<span class='line-break'> </span>$400, which would keep the turfing<span class='line-break'> </span>in good order renewing when needed,<span class='line-break'> </span>clean the monument, and paint the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence, as long as the Tappan heirs kept<span class='line-break'> </span>their portion up.

<p>The distance from the lot line to the<span class='line-break'> </span>avenue is seven 7 ft. as the avenue<span class='line-break'> </span>is now laid out, and the border should<span class='line-break'> </span>not project beyond that line.</p>

<p>After looking over the<span class='line-break'> </span>plan carefully, I can find no spot<span class='line-break'> </span>near the front entrance better suited<span class='line-break'> </span>to the purpose proposed, than the piece<span class='line-break'> </span>next the pine grove on Garden Ave.</p>
<p>This would make a lot 200 ft long<span class='line-break'> </span>and 45 ft wide &amp; would have a<span class='line-break'> </span>(flower) border on each side, and also<span class='line-break'> </span>an avenue on two sides &amp; a path on<span class='line-break'> </span>one side. If this is too large, I will<span class='line-break'> </span>sell you almost any portion, either<span class='line-break'> </span>in the center, or at either end.</p>
<p>The price for ordinary lots here is<span class='line-break'> </span>$1.75 per foot, but in consideration of<span class='line-break'> </span>the unusual size which you want,<span class='line-break'> </span>I will sell subject to the approval of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees 4500 ft or more, at $1.<sup>33 1/3</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>per square foot which includes the<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care of the grass, it being<span class='line-break'> </span>also understood that no enclosure is<span class='line-break'> </span>to be placed about the lot.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Enclosed please <span class='line-break'> </span>find the certificate of lot which<span class='line-break'> </span>you have selected.</p>
<p>I understand you propose to en<span class='line-break'></span>close the lot with a granite curbing<span class='line-break'> </span>and therefore suppose you would<span class='line-break'> </span>prefer to have the sod laid after<span class='line-break'> </span>the curb is set, as this will save<span class='line-break'> </span>some expense, and the price of<span class='line-break'> </span>the sod is included in the sale.</p>
<p>Since M<sup>r</sup> Gove's lot was purchased<span class='line-break'> </span>a rule has been made which permits<span class='line-break'> </span>no stone borders to be placed along<span class='line-break'> </span>the edges of paths or avenues, so that<span class='line-break'> </span>while the lot itself can be enclosed<span class='line-break'> </span>with granite and steps can be placed<span class='line-break'> </span>in front, the flower borders cannot be<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosed as on M<sup>r</sup> Gove's.</p>
<p>I call your attention to prevent<span class='line-break'> </span>mistake.</p>
<p>Yrs very truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>
<p>Please ask the parties of whom you<span class='line-break'> </span>order the curbing to call at the office<span class='line-break'> </span>that the grade of the lot and corners<span class='line-break'> </span>may be understood fully.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your note &amp; postal card<span class='line-break'> </span>are received. The hedge has been<span class='line-break'> </span>left uncut so long that it would<span class='line-break'> </span>be impossible to trim it so<span class='line-break'> </span>that it would look well.

<p>The perpetual care of the lot, after<span class='line-break'> </span>the fence was removed, including the<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning but not the removal of <span class='line-break'> </span>the headstones would be ($450)<span class='line-break'> </span>four hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Your postal<span class='line-break'> </span>card is received. The grave will<span class='line-break'> </span>be sodded over and left in good<span class='line-break'> </span>order as soon as we can get sod.</p>
<p>The lot needs to be regraded<span class='line-break'> </span>and resodded. The fence painted.<span class='line-break'> </span>The headstones cleaned and set up right.</p>
<p>All this would cost $63.</p>
<p>I think instead of painting the fence<span class='line-break'> </span>it should be removed, 4 of the<span class='line-break'> </span>posts rehammered for the corners,<span class='line-break'> </span>number of the lot cut on one of them.</p>
<p>This with the regrading and sodding<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning and plumbing the headstones<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $45 and old material<span class='line-break'> </span>of fence.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I enclose sketch showing<span class='line-break'> </span>the best lot I can make out of the<span class='line-break'> </span>three lots on Ivy Path. Owing to the<span class='line-break'> </span>irregularity of the ground it was nec<span class='line-break'></span>essary, in changing them into one lot<span class='line-break'> </span>to make some slight changes in the<span class='line-break'> </span>lines, which now include five hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>square feet, the price being as before $1100.<span class='line-break'> </span>You will see by the plan that there<span class='line-break'> </span>is room for ten brick catacombs.</p>
<p>I can sell you a lot of 300 square<span class='line-break'> </span>ft. on Agave Path in the rear of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Boarne tomb, which is large enough<span class='line-break'> </span>for ten catacombs, five across the<span class='line-break'> </span>back of the lot, and five across the<span class='line-break'> </span>front, leaving a space in the center<span class='line-break'> </span>for a monument or for one or two more<span class='line-break'> </span>burials for $850, or a larger lot<span class='line-break'> </span>on the same path of four hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>square feet with seven burials across<span class='line-break'> </span>the back of lot and seven across the<span class='line-break'> </span>front, with the same space between<span class='line-break'> </span>the burials as in the lot of 300 ft. The<span class='line-break'> </span>price of this lot would be $1100.</p>
<p>If this latter lot should not be large<span class='line-break'> </span>enough, I can arrange to give you<span class='line-break'> </span>more land. The arrangement of a <span class='line-break'> </span>300 ft lot would be like this,<span class='line-break'> </span>and that of a four hundred ft.<span class='line-break'> </span>lot similar to it, but with seven<span class='line-break'> </span>graves across the back instead of<span class='line-break'> </span>five.

The fence has already<span class='line-break'> </span>been removed, and the stone cutter<span class='line-break'> </span>is ready to recut the corner posts.<span class='line-break'> </span>There is some sodding which should<span class='line-break'> </span>be done &amp; this I will have attended<span class='line-break'> </span>to as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the fence will pay<span class='line-break'> </span>for part of the sodding, but there<span class='line-break'> </span>may be a balance to be paid for.</p>
<p>Yrs truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>The flowers can<span class='line-break'> </span>be planted before Memorial Day, pro<span class='line-break'></span>vided varieties such as geraniums &amp;c<span class='line-break'> </span>which are pretty hardy are selected.</p>
<p>You can select the plants if you<span class='line-break'> </span>prefer to do so, but at any rate it would<span class='line-break'> </span>be well for you to let me know<span class='line-break'> </span>how many dozen plants you would like<span class='line-break'> </span>put out. The cost of the varieties usually<span class='line-break'> </span>put out is $1<sup>50</sup> per dozen. The grass will have<span class='line-break'> </span>attention.</p>
<p>Yrs very truly<span class='line-break'> </span>J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>
<p>The myrtle will be planted as soon as good<span class='line-break'> </span>plants can be obtained, it having suffered from the winter.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am sorry to say<span class='line-break'> </span>that the myrtle on the graves in your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot like all the myrtle in the <span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery suffered badly this winter.</p>
<p>The gardener reports 6 adults and<span class='line-break'> </span>2 childrens graves as needing repairs<span class='line-break'> </span>at an expense of $24. And as that is a<span class='line-break'> </span>somewhat large bill I thought I had better<span class='line-break'> </span>write you before doing anything.</p>

<p>Your order to plant<span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle on grave is received.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There is no mis<span class='line-break'></span>understanding on the part of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation as to what they have<span class='line-break'> </span>assumed to do on lot #4073 &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>I regret very much the disappoint<span class='line-break'></span>ment you have been caused.</p>
<p>It happened in this way; the<span class='line-break'> </span>workmen prepared a number of<span class='line-break'> </span>small spots on perpetual care<span class='line-break'> </span>lots where the grass had been<span class='line-break'> </span>winter killed, for resodding, and<span class='line-break'> </span>in going over them a second time<span class='line-break'> </span>to put on the sod, by mistake sodded<span class='line-break'> </span>over the grave, thinking it a spot<span class='line-break'> </span>they had stripped for repairs, &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>the gardener on going there to put<span class='line-break'> </span>in the plants which he had been<span class='line-break'> </span>directed to do, finding the grave<span class='line-break'> </span>sodded up, delayed doing so<span class='line-break'> </span>until he had inquired again<span class='line-break'> </span>at the office whether the plants<span class='line-break'> </span>were to go or not.

<p>The time when it is safe to put<span class='line-break'> </span>out plants before decoration day, is<span class='line-break'> </span>very short, and hence there is more<span class='line-break'> </span>danger of mistake then than at<span class='line-break'> </span>other times.</p>

<p>J.V. Wellington Esq.<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>what was said by Mrs Wellington<span class='line-break'> </span>at the gate yesterday I have been<span class='line-break'> </span>at the lot this morning. I find<span class='line-break'> </span>the border does not look very well<span class='line-break'> </span>it was seeded down last year and<span class='line-break'> </span>the grass has not all come up. Knowing<span class='line-break'> </span>that it had been seeded our men did<span class='line-break'> </span>not spade it up -- so that there is too<span class='line-break'> </span>much grass for a flower bed and not<span class='line-break'> </span>enough to make the beds uniform with the<span class='line-break'> </span>other parts. The only remedy I can see<span class='line-break'> </span>is to sod over the borders.</p>
<p>The headstones are toppled and<span class='line-break'> </span>there are sunken spots in the lot.</p>
<p>If the lot was put under perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care and permission given to remove<span class='line-break'> </span>the fence the proceeds would put all these<span class='line-break'> </span>in order except the myrtle - that<span class='line-break'> </span>will have to be replanted again.<span class='line-break'> </span>The cost would be $10 for that part.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to your lot<span class='line-break'> </span>I think it needs regrading and<span class='line-break'> </span>sodding. To do the work in a thorough man<span class='line-break'></span>ner will cost $36. If you do not care<span class='line-break'> </span>to expend so large a sum the sod might<span class='line-break'> </span>be brought up by seeding etc and watering<span class='line-break'> </span>regularly that would cost $8--. There is<span class='line-break'> </span>a fence post needs repairing cost $3--.</p>
<p>The myrtle has suffered from the winter<span class='line-break'> </span>as has all the myrtle in the grounds. The<span class='line-break'> </span>repairs need[ed] will amount to $5-- The gardener<span class='line-break'> </span>reports there is too much shade for plants or shrubs<span class='line-break'> </span>to do well in the borders -- perhaps a Pyrus Japonica<span class='line-break'> </span>or Deutzia might grow.</p>

<p>In regard to the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence on your lot 950.

<p>In regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>hole of which you spoke I find the trouble<span class='line-break'> </span>is in the curbing and unless that is<span class='line-break'> </span>repaired there is no use in filling up<span class='line-break'> </span>the hole. The cost of resetting curbing<span class='line-break'> </span>securing it with clamps and leading<span class='line-break'> </span>joints including repairs to sod and<span class='line-break'> </span>filling up will be $20--.</p>
<p>The charge for filling hole alone would be<span class='line-break'> </span>$3.50 but as it would soon break out again<span class='line-break'> </span>there is no use in doing it without the others.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The openings were<span class='line-break'> </span>made in lot #1731 as you directed.</p>
<p>We found the body of Bryant O Tilden<span class='line-break'> </span>in a brick grave and that of Geo A<span class='line-break'> </span>Houghton in a box. We sounded with<span class='line-break'> </span>a steel rod for the locations of the others<span class='line-break'> </span>these have been entered on our records<span class='line-break'> </span>and herewith you will find a tracing<span class='line-break'> </span>of the plan. The size of the box of<span class='line-break'> </span>Zebiah B Tilden is doubtful but the<span class='line-break'> </span>others are to scale as near as may be.</p>
<p>In opening the myrtle had to be<span class='line-break'> </span>disturbed it was nearly dead<span class='line-break'> </span>anyway and could not be put back.<span class='line-break'> </span>Do you wish us to leave the graves as they<span class='line-break'> </span>now are or plant new myrtle?</p>
<p>In regard to the addition<span class='line-break'> </span>I find you can get a strip 2'-6" wide<span class='line-break'> </span>(50 sqr ft) on the side next to the Coffin lot<span class='line-break'> </span>#2850. The price including the deed will<span class='line-break'> </span>be $52<sup>00</sup>/100. This will admit of only<span class='line-break'> </span>two more interments or with crowding<span class='line-break'> </span>three. A similar strip could be<span class='line-break'> </span>sold on the opposite side of the lot.</p>

<p>It is not proposed at<span class='line-break'> </span>present to lay out and construct the<span class='line-break'> </span>path in the rear of Mrs Mark's Lot, named<span class='line-break'> </span>Dahlia path on the plan, but if she wishes<span class='line-break'> </span>to increase the size of that Lot, land can<span class='line-break'> </span>be sold her then, with the understanding<span class='line-break'> </span>that Dahlia path will not be built at<span class='line-break'> </span>present.</p>
<p>A lot of 20' x 15' or 20' x 20' on Dahlia<span class='line-break'> </span>path would be sold for $850 and $1100<span class='line-break'> </span>respectively, and these prices include<span class='line-break'> </span>the perpetual care of the grass, which<span class='line-break'> </span>is the only way in which any lots are sold.</p>
<p>Even purchases the layer of these Lots<span class='line-break'> </span>should she desire to enclose with her<span class='line-break'> </span>present Lot, it can be done by paying<span class='line-break'> </span>for the land in the rear of the lots at<span class='line-break'> </span>the same rate as for the lot, less the<span class='line-break'> </span>rate already paid for it as passegeway,<span class='line-break'> </span>but it seems to me it would be better<span class='line-break'> </span>to take it as a separate lot, because the<span class='line-break'> </span>grade of Dahlia path will be lower<span class='line-break'> </span>than Garden Ave. so that it will not<span class='line-break'> </span>be feasible to enclose the new lot with<span class='line-break'> </span>a curb on the same grade as the en<span class='line-break'></span>closure of her present lot, and to lower<span class='line-break'> </span>the grade of the present enclosure on<span class='line-break'> </span>the back (which would be necessary to<span class='line-break'> </span>conform to the proposed grade of Dahlia<span class='line-break'> </span>path, would bring the present lot <span class='line-break'> </span>at the back lower than the adjoining<span class='line-break'> </span>ones, and might not be altogether sat<span class='line-break'></span>isfactory.

<p>The iron fence formerly about the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>was removed and the lot put in<span class='line-break'> </span>good order at an expense of some<span class='line-break'> </span>$85<sup>00</sup> just before the contract for<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care was made.</p>
<p>The lot has been cared for each year<span class='line-break'> </span>since, by cutting grass, weeding seeding<span class='line-break'> </span>watering &amp; top dressing; plants have been<span class='line-break'> </span>set out in the front borders; the marble<span class='line-break'> </span>has twice received special care &amp; cleaning,<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot has been resodded once (in 1880)<span class='line-break'> </span>and the sod repaired at other times &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>the myrtle has been repaired, all at an<span class='line-break'> </span>expense to Dec 31 [18]82 of $95<sup>50</sup>/100.</p>
<p>An examination of all the perpet<span class='line-break'></span>ual care lots was made last week<span class='line-break'> </span>and I find on my memorandum<span class='line-break'> </span>book an order to repair the sod &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>the myrtle; this work is not yet done.</p>
<p>There are four or five trees near enough<span class='line-break'> </span>to the lot to shade it very considerably<span class='line-break'> </span>and the removal of one, on the left<span class='line-break'> </span>hand side of the lot (near the front<span class='line-break'> </span>corner post) as you stand facing the <span class='line-break'> </span>lot, would give the grass more sun</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In 1878 Mr. John F. Poor requested<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees to exchange his lot #3119 on Rosebay Ave (con<span class='line-break'></span>taining 865 square ft) for two lots on the Stone Farm of the<span class='line-break'> </span>same size, which they voted to do by his paying for the <span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care of the new lots ($865), nothing being allowed <span class='line-break'> </span>for the graite curbing around lot #3119; but this arrangement<span class='line-break'> </span>was not satisfactory to M<sup>r</sup> Poor.</p>
<p>In 1880 he renewed his request, and the matter <span class='line-break'> </span>was referred to the Comm. on Lots with power, but no<span class='line-break'> </span>agreement was arrived at, as to an exchange, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the lot was finally redivided into two lots, #3119 &amp; #4390<span class='line-break'> </span>containing 432 <sup>1</sup>/2 ft each, at M<sup>r</sup> Poor's request, and it was<span class='line-break'> </span>supposed that the matter was finally settled.</p>
<p>M<sup>r</sup> Poor has been at the Cemetery this week and <span class='line-break'> </span>selected the following lots, one of which he proposes to <span class='line-break'> </span>ask the Comm. to exchange for the two lots #3119 &amp; #4390.<span class='line-break'> </span>1<sup>st</sup> lot on Fountain Ave 400 ft. price $1200- (<sup>land</sup>800 + <sup>perpetual care</sup>300  + <sup>sod'g grad'g post &amp;c</sup>100)<span class='line-break'> </span>2<sup>nd</sup> [lot on] Smilax path 400 ft [price] $1080- (700 + 300 + 80)</p>

<p>Lots 3119 &amp; 4390 contain 865 ft, are not under perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care, and are enclosed by a granite curbing, in common<span class='line-break'> </span>with Lot #3120 (Stickney)</p>
<p>If the Corporation made the exchange, unless M<sup>r </sup>Stickney<span class='line-break'> </span>or his friends would purchase the Lots #3119 &amp; 4390, as they are<span class='line-break'> </span>large lots, and enclosed in a curbing with another Lot, they<span class='line-break'> </span>could not be sold as readily as if the curbing were removed.</p>
<p>To remove the curbing from the two Poor Lots, and leave<span class='line-break'> </span>the Stickney Lots enclosed, moving the steps now common to<span class='line-break'> </span>both Lots, to the front of the Stickney lot, would probably cost<span class='line-break'> </span>$125, and when this was done the land could be sold<span class='line-break'> </span>in two, or perhaps more readily in four, lots of two hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>feet each, price $450 = (land $250 + perpet. care $150 + grad etc $50),<span class='line-break'> </span>the sale of the four yielding $1000 for land, 6oo for perpetual care <span class='line-break'> </span>and $200 for the grading &amp;c.</p>
<p>The $600 would go into the fund for the care of the four<span class='line-break'> </span>new lots; the $200 would remove the old curbing from lots 3119<span class='line-break'> </span>4390 and reset it around the Stickney lot #3120, (leaving the<span class='line-break'> </span>space occupied by the Poor Lots unenclosed) and provide the<span class='line-break'> </span>necessary corner posts &amp;c to mark the new lots; the $1000 the<span class='line-break'> </span>proceeds of the land alone, would be available therefore toward<span class='line-break'> </span>the payment of the new lot selected, one of which costs $1080<span class='line-break'> </span>and the other $1250.</p>

The number of lot<span class='line-break'> </span>will be cut according to custom on the<span class='line-break'> </span>front right hand corner post unless<span class='line-break'> </span>you order otherwise.</p>
<p>There is a possibility of a misunder<span class='line-break'></span>-standing as to the filling referred to.<span class='line-break'> </span>My estimate was for raising the sunken<span class='line-break'> </span>grave not removing the tree stump<span class='line-break'> </span>(outside the lot) and filling up. That<span class='line-break'> </span>could not be done for less than $15-</p>

<p>As the new hedge will be narrower<span class='line-break'> </span>than the evergreen, some sodding<span class='line-break'> </span>will be needed, but I think it will<span class='line-break'> </span>be better to set the hedge first and<span class='line-break'> </span>then ascertain just how much sodding<span class='line-break'> </span>is necessary. No sodding is included<span class='line-break'> </span>in this estimate.</p>
<p>I suppose it is intended to<span class='line-break'> </span>enclose both lots as before, but if<span class='line-break'> </span>only your own lot is to be enclosed<span class='line-break'> </span>the cost will be ($40) forty dollars.</p>

<p>I have been notified by the<span class='line-break'> </span>undertakers whom M<sup>r</sup> Holman em<span class='line-break'></span>ployed at his wife's funeral that<span class='line-break'> </span>it is proposed during October to <span class='line-break'> </span>remove the remains from the Receiving<span class='line-break'> </span>Tomb here, to Forest Hills Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>for interment, and that all fees<span class='line-break'> </span>for use of the tomb would then be<span class='line-break'> </span>paid, so that it would not appear<span class='line-break'> </span>that I should be justified in taking<span class='line-break'> </span>any action in the matter, as all <span class='line-break'> </span>the rules &amp; regulations in regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>the deposit of a body in the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>would have been complied with.</p>
<p>Should there by any change of <span class='line-break'> </span>circumstances, which would make<span class='line-break'> </span>it possible to comply with your<span class='line-break'> </span>request, I will endeavor to notify<span class='line-break'> </span>you.</p>

<p>Enclosed<span class='line-break'> </span>please find sketch of the Upham<span class='line-break'> </span>tomb as at present, which<span class='line-break'> </span>shows the dimensions of the granite<span class='line-break'> </span>steps and platform in front.</p>
<p>I should recommend the re<span class='line-break'></span>moval of the edge stones marked<span class='line-break'> </span>A and the side stones reaching<span class='line-break'> </span>from them to the tomb (marked B)<span class='line-break'> </span>and that the entrance platform be<span class='line-break'> </span>shortened not more than 24 inches.</p>
<p>This I am satisfied will improve<span class='line-break'> </span>the appearance of the path &amp;c<span class='line-break'> </span>and I consider that it is for<span class='line-break'> </span>the advantage of all to make<span class='line-break'> </span>the change.</p>
<p>Should you desire to see it on<span class='line-break'> </span>the ground, please call at the office<span class='line-break'> </span>opposite gate &amp; explain what you<span class='line-break'> </span>desire to see and someone will<span class='line-break'> </span>go to the lot &amp; explain the change<span class='line-break'> </span>proposed.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>During the<span class='line-break'> </span>past summer considerable im<span class='line-break'></span>provements have been made<span class='line-break'> </span>in grading and new paths near<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot of the late John B. Brown<span class='line-break'> </span>(#192 on Violet Path) which you<span class='line-break'> </span>now represent and it would<span class='line-break'> </span>seem to me that certain changes<span class='line-break'> </span>could be made in your lot<span class='line-break'> </span>which would improve the appear<span class='line-break'></span>ance of your lot very much, as<span class='line-break'> </span>well as the general surroundings,<span class='line-break'> </span>so that I take the liberty to suggest<span class='line-break'> </span>that the fence be removed, and that<span class='line-break'> </span>the grade of the lot be raised in<span class='line-break'> </span>the rear to the height at which<span class='line-break'> </span>the top rail now stands, and that<span class='line-break'> </span>the surface of the lot be regraded<span class='line-break'> </span>so as to slope forward from the<span class='line-break'> </span>back of the lot, raised as explained<span class='line-break'> </span>above, to the front which should be<span class='line-break'> </span>not over a foot lower than now.</p>
<p>If this regrading were done, it<span class='line-break'> </span>would be possible to make the<span class='line-break'> </span>path on the N. side of the lot more<span class='line-break'> </span>gradual and would much improve<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot.</p>
<p>Will you kindly give the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>your consideration and I hope <span class='line-break'> </span>that the change may strike you<span class='line-break'> </span>favorably.</p>
<p>Should you feel disposed to come<span class='line-break'> </span>out and see the proposed changes</p>

<p>In reply to <span class='line-break'> </span>your favor of the 16<sup>th</sup>.

When you<span class='line-break'> </span>decide, will you please insert the<span class='line-break'> </span>day &amp; hour &amp; sign the enclosed blank<span class='line-break'> </span>and return to me, and please<span class='line-break'> </span>state at same time, whether a<span class='line-break'> </span>brick vault is to be placed in the<span class='line-break'> </span>new lot for your mother's remains, &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>if it is to be on the right hand ^<sup>(as you face the lot)</sup> side<span class='line-break'> </span>of your father's grave which is the<span class='line-break'> </span>usual place.</p>
<p>The brick grave can be prepared &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>the grave in the old lot opened so<span class='line-break'> </span>that when you reach here you<span class='line-break'> </span>would find every thing ready to<span class='line-break'> </span>have the transfer made in a <span class='line-break'> </span>short time.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, I think<span class='line-break'> </span>the old stone might be removed, but<span class='line-break'> </span>it should be set as low as possible.<span class='line-break'> </span>No shrub of any kind would be<span class='line-break'> </span>allowed as a hedge or mark around<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot, but myrtle or annual<span class='line-break'> </span>flowers can be planted, but <span class='line-break'> </span>when in straight lines, I think</p>

<p>Eugene B. Hinckley Esq</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am in receipt of<span class='line-break'> </span>a letter from D<sup>r</sup> Read (in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>to some estimate for work on the<span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup>c</sup>Lellan tomb) in which he requests<span class='line-break'> </span>that my reply be sent to you.</p>
<p>The first estimate given to D<sup>r</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>Read did not include the resodding<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot, but in other respects was<span class='line-break'> </span>for the same work substantially, as the<span class='line-break'> </span>second estimate, the amount asked<span class='line-break'> </span>was $54 with a credit for the old ir<span class='line-break'></span>on fence.</p>
<p>The second estimate given to Mrs<span class='line-break'> </span>Read did include the whole resodding<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot, and was for a larger<span class='line-break'> </span>amount, less a credit of <sup rend='sup'>$</sup>14 for the<span class='line-break'> </span>old iron leaving the net cost <sup rend='sup'>$</sup>50.<sup rend='sup'>00</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>and this agrees with the written<span class='line-break'> </span>order which Mrs Read signed for<span class='line-break'> </span>the work, and also with the statement<span class='line-break'> </span>made to M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Namee in regard to it.</p>
<p>The corporation do not desire to<span class='line-break'> </span>take any part of the lot to increase<span class='line-break'> </span>the width of the avenue, but as the<span class='line-break'> </span>M<sup rend='sup'>c</sup>Lellan lot projects some two or<span class='line-break'> </span>three feet beyond the line of the ad<span class='line-break'></span>joining lots, it was suggested that<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot would look better, if it<span class='line-break'> </span>was pushed back (with not reducing<span class='line-break'> </span>its size at all) on to a line with the<span class='line-break'> </span>other lots, but the change is proposed<span class='line-break'> </span>simply in the interest of the M<sup rend='sup'>c</sup>Lellan<span class='line-break'> </span>lot. If you desire to have it made</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In regard to your<span class='line-break'> </span>claim for an abatement of [$16?]<span class='line-break'> </span>because of the renewal of the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence. The difference in the <span class='line-break'> </span>estimate was made on the supposition<span class='line-break'> </span>that the work would be all done<span class='line-break'> </span>at the same time. You can see<span class='line-break'> </span>how much quicker the workman<span class='line-break'> </span>could have done this work if the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence had not been there to impede<span class='line-break'> </span>them and if they had not to carry<span class='line-break'> </span>all their material in at one<span class='line-break'> </span>narrow gate. Then in now renewing<span class='line-break'> </span>the fence and taking up the posts<span class='line-break'> </span>we will destroy part of the sod just<span class='line-break'> </span>laid. All the credit that could be<span class='line-break'> </span>allowed would be $2. The work<span class='line-break'> </span>has not yet been done and under <span class='line-break'> </span>these circumstances do you decire it<span class='line-break'> </span>to go on.</p>

<p>Richard H. Salter M.D.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have measured<span class='line-break'> </span>this afternoon the change of<span class='line-break'> </span>grade of the path in front of<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot, and find it has been<span class='line-break'> </span>lowered thirteen inches, and I<span class='line-break'> </span>find that the lot is about a<span class='line-break'> </span>foot above the adjoining lots,<span class='line-break'> </span>so that if the grade of the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>is not changed at all, it will<span class='line-break'> </span>be about two feet above the<span class='line-break'> </span>path, and if the grade is low<span class='line-break'></span>ered to conform to that of the<span class='line-break'> </span>adjoining lots, the lot will be<span class='line-break'> </span>just as much above the changed<span class='line-break'> </span>path, as the lot (as now) graded<span class='line-break'> </span>was above the [Ave?] path.</p>
<p>In regard to the expense of the<span class='line-break'> </span>changes, I am disposed to do<span class='line-break'> </span>what is fair, as you feel that<span class='line-break'> </span>you are rather compelled to make<span class='line-break'> </span>the change.</p>
<p>I will regrade the lot, lowering<span class='line-break'> </span>the surface about a foot, to con<span class='line-break'></span>form to the adjoining lots, using<span class='line-break'> </span>over the same sod now on the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>without expense to you, or if you<span class='line-break'> </span>desire a new turf, I will<span class='line-break'> </span>make the change &amp; supply the new<span class='line-break'> </span>sod for $20.</p>
<p>Please let me hear your decision<span class='line-break'> </span>soon, as it is getting late in the <span class='line-break'> </span>season, &amp; it is desirable that the work<span class='line-break'> </span>should go on.</p>

<p>The enclosed bill is<span class='line-break'> </span>correct, the top dressing having been<span class='line-break'> </span>put on just after the completion of the<span class='line-break'> </span>stonework.</p>
<p>I do not see how the grade could<span class='line-break'> </span>be changed without serious injury to<span class='line-break'> </span>the adjoining lots, and I do not believe<span class='line-break'> </span>that the change wich has been sug<span class='line-break'></span>gested would improve matters at<span class='line-break'> </span>all.</p>
<p>My advice would be to leave the work<span class='line-break'> </span>as now, tho' when the sodding around the<span class='line-break'> </span>monument is completed in the spring<span class='line-break'> </span>it will probably improve the ap<span class='line-break'></span>pearance of the monument</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have examined<span class='line-break'> </span>lot #4299, standing on our books in<span class='line-break'> </span>name of Cha<sup rend='sup'>s</sup>. S. Butler, but owned in<span class='line-break'> </span>part, I understand, by heirs of W<sup><u>m</u></sup><span class='line-break'> </span>B. Spooner, with reference to provision<span class='line-break'> </span>for the perpetual care of the portion<span class='line-break'> </span>owned by the Spooner heirs.</p>
<p>I see no way in which the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>can be divided or by which a contract<span class='line-break'> </span>for perpetual care with guaranty could<span class='line-break'> </span>be made except for the whole lot &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>then thro. M<sup rend='sup'>r</sup> Butler.</p>
<p>If he would join with the Spooner heirs<span class='line-break'> </span>and put the lot under perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care, each party could pay the proper<span class='line-break'> </span>proportion, or such proportions as agreed<span class='line-break'> </span>on among themselves.</p>
<p>The perpetual care of the whole lot<span class='line-break'> </span>including annual plants in the border<span class='line-break'> </span>to front of lot, the care of the turf, and 3<span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle graves, the cleaning of the<span class='line-break'> </span>marble, and repairs of the curbing<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $500.<sup><u>00</u></sup> and if the head<span class='line-break'></span>stones are to be renewed when worn<span class='line-break'> </span>or damaged $625<sup><u>00</u></sup>. This includes no<span class='line-break'> </span>flowers on the graves on M<sup rend='sup'>r</sup> Butler's<span class='line-break'> </span>half which has been extensively [dec.?]<span class='line-break'> </span>several years. This could be provided<span class='line-break'> </span>for each year as heretofore.</p>
<p>If M<sup rend='sup'>r</sup> Butler does not wish to<span class='line-break'> </span>join in such an arrangement, I<span class='line-break'> </span>can think of but one way to arrange<span class='line-break'> </span>the matter, where the Spooner heirs should</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I called at your<span class='line-break'> </span>office this morning but did not find<span class='line-break'> </span>you in.</p>
<p>You may be glad to know without<span class='line-break'> </span>waiting to see me, that the trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>will accept a deed of reconveyance<span class='line-break'> </span>of lot #2131 for the purpose of restricting<span class='line-break'> </span>and regulating the right of burial,<span class='line-break'> </span>and this without any charge being<span class='line-break'> </span>made in the contract for the per<span class='line-break'></span>petual care of the lot.</p>
<p>If you desire to reconvey the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot to the Corporation in trust, if<span class='line-break'> </span>you will send word to the Secretary<span class='line-break'> </span>at 16 Pemberton Sq. what you desire<span class='line-break'> </span>to effect by the reconveyance, the<span class='line-break'> </span>proper papers will be drawn up,<span class='line-break'> </span>and submitted to you for examination<span class='line-break'> </span>and execution.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your<span class='line-break'> </span>favor of the 18<sup>th</sup> inst. I would say that<span class='line-break'> </span>the probable cost of perpetual care<span class='line-break'> </span>would be from $450 to 500.</p>
<p>For the care of the lot with plants &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>including the cleaning but not the<span class='line-break'> </span>renewal of the headstones now on lot<span class='line-break'> </span>$475 or $400 without plants.</p>
<p>If the headstone on the lot is to be<span class='line-break'> </span>renewed when necessary-, $500 with<span class='line-break'> </span>plants or $425 without plants.</p>
<p>I don't know that I can give you<span class='line-break'> </span>any special information which is not<span class='line-break'> </span>contained in the report, but I will<span class='line-break'> </span>give you information as far as I can,<span class='line-break'> </span>on such permits as you desire if you<span class='line-break'> </span>will write me.</p>
<p>I have not a blank form of the<span class='line-break'> </span>contracts here, but will send them<span class='line-break'> </span>in a few days.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I find that there will be<span class='line-break'> </span>fifty linear feet of hedge to<span class='line-break'> </span>be set out to take the place of<span class='line-break'> </span>that now there, and that when<span class='line-break'> </span>the present hedge is taken away<span class='line-break'> </span>some sodding would be very desir<span class='line-break'></span>able on the banks in the rear of<span class='line-break'> </span>the hedge.</p>
<p>The whole cost of the hedge<span class='line-break'> </span>(the plants to be 18 to 20 inches high)<span class='line-break'> </span>and sodding, including some special<span class='line-break'> </span>care in the way of watering which<span class='line-break'> </span>would be necessary for the first<span class='line-break'> </span>season, would be forty five dollars.</p>
<p>The Frothingham lot is under<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care, so that for that<span class='line-break'> </span>portion of the hedge, we should<span class='line-break'> </span>receive payment from the fund,<span class='line-break'> </span>leaving $22<sup>50</sup> to be paid by the<span class='line-break'> </span>owners of the other lot.</p>
<p>As soon as you deside when<span class='line-break'> </span>you will have the scarlet^<sup>variety </sup> or not.<span class='line-break'> </span>please advise me, that I may<span class='line-break'> </span>order the plants.</p>

<p>P.S. I neglected to say, that I<span class='line-break'> </span>think the scarlet variety makes<span class='line-break'> </span>rather the best hedge, tho' the blossoms<span class='line-break'> </span>of the pink &amp; white, is more beautiful.</p>

<p>I think the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>of the addition to the Earle lot<span class='line-break'> </span>could be best arranged on the<span class='line-break'> </span>ground and if you are likely to<span class='line-break'> </span>be here again, it would be the<span class='line-break'> </span>more satisfactory way, but I will<span class='line-break'> </span>explain as clearly as I can by [letter?]</p>
<p>An addition of two and one<span class='line-break'> </span>half feet can be sold on the<span class='line-break'> </span>right hand side of the lot. (as you<span class='line-break'> </span>stand on the Avenue facing the lot)<span class='line-break'> </span>but there is a difficulty in the<span class='line-break'> </span>way of adding more, which is</p>
<p>caused by the banking at the rear<span class='line-break'> </span>sloping [so..?] to the lots below.</p>
<p>I find that there is not room for<span class='line-break'> </span>this bank, if an addition of greater<span class='line-break'> </span>width should be sold, but there is<span class='line-break'> </span>one way in which it might be<span class='line-break'> </span>done. The headstones on the back<span class='line-break'> </span>line of your lot do not set back<span class='line-break'> </span>as far as the near line of the lot, and<span class='line-break'> </span>if you were willing to have this<span class='line-break'> </span>line moved forward so as to touch<span class='line-break'> </span>the bases of the headstones then I<span class='line-break'> </span>think an addition might be sold<span class='line-break'> </span>between five and six feet in width<span class='line-break'> </span>providing the owners of the adjoining<span class='line-break'> </span>lot do not wish to purchase any<span class='line-break'> </span>part of it themselves.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>In regard to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Allen lot #1551 I find that it<span class='line-break'> </span>will cost $40- to put it in repair<span class='line-break'> </span>or if the fence is removed (as it ought to<span class='line-break'> </span>be) $35 and old material.</p>
<p>There are 7 interments now in the<span class='line-break'> </span>lot and 4 or 5 adults can yet<span class='line-break'> </span>be interred there</p>
<p>If the lot were <u>vacant</u> it would be<span class='line-break'> </span>worth about $500-</p>

<p>A lady called here today<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to plants in lot #848-</p>
<p>In case there should be any mis<span class='line-break'></span>-understanding I would say that<span class='line-break'> </span>on lot #847 where the depsit was made <span class='line-break'> </span>for perpetual care plants were<span class='line-break'> </span>set out last year and will be this<span class='line-break'> </span>but on #848 we did not understand that<span class='line-break'> </span>they were wanted and have not set out any<span class='line-break'> </span>since 1881.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Since writing<span class='line-break'> </span>you in regard to the Longfellow<span class='line-break'> </span>monument, I have learned that<span class='line-break'> </span>the makers marked the line on<span class='line-break'> </span>the monument showing the height<span class='line-break'> </span>on the base above the sod, and that<span class='line-break'> </span>it was necessary in order to set it<span class='line-break'> </span>to the mark to fill in again [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>if not all of the foundation which<span class='line-break'> </span>was taken off after the foundation<span class='line-break'> </span>was built in accordance with your<span class='line-break'> </span>instructions.</p>
<p>Under the condition of things, there</p>
<p>can be no difficulty in lowering<span class='line-break'> </span>the whole monument, without [taking?]<span class='line-break'> </span>it down, four inches and I think this<span class='line-break'> </span>will be less expensive than raising<span class='line-break'> </span>the grade &amp; trust it may meet <span class='line-break'> </span>with your approval.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Mr McArthur has<span class='line-break'> </span>handed in the enclosed bill to be returned<span class='line-break'> </span>to you. He says the sod looks well<span class='line-break'> </span>except around the corners of curbing and<span class='line-break'> </span>around headstones and monument</p>
<p>Two small headstones are out of plumb<span class='line-break'> </span>and should be righted. And the<span class='line-break'> </span>statue should be cleaned. The <span class='line-break'> </span>expense of all this would be<span class='line-break'> </span>about $6~</p>
<p>3642.</p>
<p>Very respectfully</p>
<p>JW Lovering<sub>Supt</sub></p>

<p>Boston</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Your note is<span class='line-break'> </span>received. I very much regret the<span class='line-break'> </span>trouble and annoyance the bodiees<span class='line-break'> </span>were subject to. It appears that<span class='line-break'> </span>the gate keeper made a mistake as<span class='line-break'> </span>to the funeral - I am glad<span class='line-break'> </span>you called my attention to the matter<span class='line-break'> </span>as it will prevent a recurrence of the<span class='line-break'> </span>same thing - We have an order for the care<span class='line-break'> </span>of your lot until countermanded so that a<span class='line-break'> </span>circular did not need to be sent. The<span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning etc will have attention</p>
<p>Very respectfully</p>
<p>JW Lovering</p>
