<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Your letter of 10th has been forwarded me by our Treas<span class='line-break'></span>urer.  Lot #2620 on Orchis pah is triangular in shape, and con<span class='line-break'></span>tains 150 sq. feet.  The two interments now there were made before<span class='line-break'> </span>we kept the exact locations of the bodies, so that without digging<span class='line-break'> </span>down it is impossible to tell how much space is left.  From the<span class='line-break'> </span>appearance of the surface there may be room for two more graves,<span class='line-break'> </span>but the surface indications are not always reliable.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Supt.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Your note of 12th is received.  I have made enquiry as <span class='line-break'> </span>to the North River stone but am unable to get a quotation as low as <span class='line-break'> </span>you give.  It is not often that we need this stone, so that we<span class='line-break'> </span>would not be likely to get it at a low figure; would it not be well <span class='line-break'> </span>therefore for you to procure the stone and send it here when we can <span class='line-break'> </span>set it.  The size needed is an odd one, and I have not found a <span class='line-break'> </span>dealer in Boston who has it.  If the projection is 2 inches each <span class='line-break'> </span>stone will require to be 8' - 8" x 3' - 5" x 0' -  3". In making an <span class='line-break'> </span>interment it will be very awkward to handle so large a stone.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>The cost of building a foundation and setting a headstone<span class='line-break'> </span>as per sketch in your letter of 24th will be $6.40, the stones to <span class='line-break'> </span>be delivered in this cemetery.  If the stonecutter does not send<span class='line-break'> </span>dowells with the stone or  prepare the holes to receive them, there <span class='line-break'> </span>will be an extra charge.</p>
<p>We build foundations the exact size of the base stone<span class='line-break'> </span>and down to the lower edge of the grave (5' - 6").  When the foun<span class='line-break'></span>dation is larger than the stone a yellow margin of sod shows around the bse.</p>
<p>Stones coming from New York are usually carried by the <span class='line-break'> </span>Metropolitan S. S.

There is no freight depot near here, so it is very much<span class='line-break'> </span>better to send direct to Boston.</p>

<p>Miss Mary T. Bradford,<span class='line-break'> </span>Lancaster, Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>Your note is received.  To spade up the lot, enrich<span class='line-break'> </span>with manure, add sufficient loam to fill up the depressions and <span class='line-break'> </span>sow grass seed will cost $25.00</p>
<p>For the same work, but instead of seeding to replace the <span class='line-break'> </span>sod as far as it will go , and furnish the balance needed to resod<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot will cost $35.00.</p>
<p>Both these estimates include the care of the lot for 1889<span class='line-break'> </span>but not the replanting of the myrtle, the understanding being that <span class='line-break'> </span>it will be removed.</p>
<p>Building proper foundations under seven headstones and <span class='line-break'> </span>setting them will cost $34.40.  Our rules require that all stones <span class='line-break'> </span>be set on foundations that are built to the lower edge of the grave <span class='line-break'> </span>(about 5' - 6" ), and our experieince is that a less depth will not <span class='line-break'> </span>make permanent work.</p>
<p>Cleaning all the stone in the lot will cost $10.00</p>
<p>The old fence will pay for its removal, recutting four<span class='line-break'> </span>posts for the corners, removing the other posts and filling up the <span class='line-break'> </span>holes and cutting the number of the lot, provided the work is done <span class='line-break'> </span>at the same time as the grading.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>If the lot is sown with grass seed a permanent sod cannot <span class='line-break'> </span>be had as soon, and the lot would have to be watered by hose for at <span class='line-break'> </span>least two years, so that in the end the charge would be quite as <span class='line-break'> </span>much.</p>
<p>the order for work does not necessarily need to be wri<span class='line-break'></span>tten on our blanks you can write in an orderinary letter your direct<span class='line-break'></span>ions as to the particular work you wish done, and this letter will <span class='line-break'> </span>be your voucher as to price.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>Your note to our Treasurer has been forwarded to me for <span class='line-break'> </span>answer.  I am sorry that the bill sent you for repairs to the <span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle is not satisfactory.  I have examined the charge, and do not <span class='line-break'> </span>think it is an unfair one.  The charges for repairs to myrtle <span class='line-break'> </span>are more unsatisfactory to both sides than any other class of work we<span class='line-break'> </span>do. If the myrtle is not in good condition in the Spring follow<span class='line-break'></span>ing the repairs we are expected to make it good.  In fairness to <span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation I do not see that any deduction could be made in <span class='line-break'> </span>your bill, unless you are willing to take the risk of the young<span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle going over the winter, in which case a reduction of $2.50<span class='line-break'> </span>might be made.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Dear Sirs: -</p>
<p>As a difficulty which can easily be obviated has been <span class='line-break'> </span>found in setting some of the headstones you have been sending here,<span class='line-break'> </span>I desire to call your attention to it believing you will consider <span class='line-break'> </span>it for your interest to remedy it in future, and thereby give those <span class='line-break'> </span>who employ you a more substantial piece of work with probably no <span class='line-break'> </span>increase of expense.</p>
<p>The stones in question have come with a rough socket base <span class='line-break'> </span>as indicated in the sketch, the tablet being cut so that this base <span class='line-break'> </span>cannot be set more than 3 or 4 inches below sod.  The result is a <span class='line-break'> </span>yellow margin of dead sod around the stone from the want of soil.<span class='line-break'> </span>These bases ought to be at least one foot under the sod, and it <span class='line-break'> </span>would be very much better and probably might curtail the expense <span class='line-break'> </span>[?] foundation by reducing its size, if the base stone was dis<span class='line-break'></span>pensed with altogether, and the tablet made long enough and built <span class='line-break'> </span>into the foundation, which should be covered by at least twelve <span class='line-break'> </span>inches of soil.</p>
<p>As the Corporation has in many cases ageed to keep the<span class='line-break'> </span>grass in perpetual care, it is necessary that the stones be so <span class='line-break'> </span>designed that this is possible.</p>

<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>The gardener has<span class='line-break'> </span>looked at the ivy on your lot #3225<span class='line-break'> </span>and says he does not think he can make<span class='line-break'> </span>it grow outside in the winter as they<span class='line-break'> </span>are not at all hardy.

<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>The enclosed bill has been forwarded to me by our<span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer with the request to send you an explanation as to the<span class='line-break'> </span>plants charged. These plants were ordered for this year only, by<span class='line-break'> </span>a lady who came here I think to inspect a monument, the order on<span class='line-break'> </span>file here was signed for you by Col A. A. Rand of Boston.</p>
<p>There is no order for topdressing, nor is it charged in<span class='line-break'> </span>this bill. Am I to understand your note as ordering it now?</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Supt.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Your note is received, there are several Magoun lots in<span class='line-break'> </span>this cemetery and I do not know to which you refer.

<p>When not ordered by the proprietor these bills are pay<span class='line-break'></span>able in advance. The cost of these two foundations will be $17.80.<span class='line-break'> </span>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Dear Madam:-</p>
<p>Your order to set two markers is received, but you do<span class='line-break'> </span>not say where they are to be set. Please give me the exact loca<span class='line-break'></span>tion in the lot, or if there is any doubt it would be well to show<span class='line-break'> </span>the location on the lot. The stone marked L. A. R. is I suppose<span class='line-break'> </span>to be placed at the grave of Mrs. Richards, and at the end furthest<span class='line-break'> </span>from the path. If that is correct we have the exact location of<span class='line-break'> </span>the grave and can set that without further instructions, but we do<span class='line-break'> </span>not know at which side of this you wish the other stone set.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>I tried twice this afternoon to send you a message by <span class='line-break'> </span>telephone, but was informed that the line was out of order.</p>
<p>The longest distance we can get for Dr. Putnam's grave <span class='line-break'> </span>is 6' - 4", and as your box has not come I cannot tell if this will <span class='line-break'> </span>do.  If the box is longer I suppose you can make the interment<span class='line-break'> </span>without it.  Dr. Putnam arranged the space himself, and I have no <span class='line-break'> </span>doubt knew the distance.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>The grade as proposed for the Simonds lot #3757 would <span class='line-break'> </span>not admit of front steps.  The rear would be kept substantially <span class='line-break'> </span>as now and the grade rise to the front (East) two inches per foot, and<span class='line-break'> </span>from left to right (South to North) would fall three fourths of an <span class='line-break'> </span>inch per foot.  As you will notrice there is considerable fall from <span class='line-break'> </span>front to rear which would be bad for a monument of any great width <span class='line-break'> </span>and as the lot is only about 16 feet long a narrow monument would <span class='line-break'> </span>give more graves.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>Your note of 17th has been forwarded to me by our <span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer for answer.</p>
<p>The sum needed for the perpetual care of lot #1662 incl<span class='line-break'></span>uding six myrtle graves, and the cleaning and renewal of the sar<span class='line-break'></span>cophagus and four headstones, will be $700.00.  If the cleaning <span class='line-break'> </span>only and not the renewal is included, he sum needed will be <span class='line-break'> </span>$500.00, and if the myrtle is removed from the lot the sum needed <span class='line-break'> </span>will be $150.00 less.</p>
<p>The perpetual care of a lot includes more than the care <span class='line-break'> </span>and occasional topdressing you pay for annually.  Lots under  per<span class='line-break'></span>petual care contracts are likely to have much better care, and are <span class='line-break'> </span>topdressed oftener.  In the contracts for perpetal care are inc<span class='line-break'></span>luded many small repairs to the sod, and even the entire resodding,<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot, if needed, which are items of extra expense in addition <span class='line-break'> </span>to the usual annual charges.  Th perpetual care contract is for <span class='line-break'> </span>all time, and under it the corporation assumes the risk of the <span class='line-break'> </span>cost of labor, materials and the rate of interest hereafter.  If <span class='line-break'> </span>you desire to assume this risk, a donation of say $300.00 could <span class='line-break'> </span>be made, and the corporation will keep the principal whole and</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>I have looked up the matter of the location of the head<span class='line-break'></span>stones in regard to which you called.  I find that the headstone <span class='line-break'> </span>of the late Mrs. Mary E. Piper is not exactly over its foundation.<span class='line-break'> </span>If it is moved so that the space between it and that of Solomon <span class='line-break'> </span>Piper will be the same as between that and the one of Jerusha Piper <span class='line-break'> </span>it will then be practically ovr its foundation.  It appears that <span class='line-break'> </span>in planting the myrtle we did not place it exactly over the grave <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mrs. Mary E. Piper, and if you will have the stone moved to its<span class='line-break'> </span>new position, will have have the myrtle replanted so as to centre on <span class='line-break'> </span>it as soon as such work can be done in the Spring.</p>
<p>The gardener reports that he covered the myrtle on the <span class='line-break'> </span>graves of Solomon Piper and Jerusha Piper, but that he now finds<span class='line-break'> </span>it uncovered.  The covering will be replaced.</p>

<p>An addition of 70 sq. ft., that is a strip about five <span class='line-break'> </span>ft. wide, could be sold for interment purposes, or for placing a <span class='line-break'> </span>monument, this is the land in which the flower beds are now cut.<span class='line-break'> </span>The banks could not be carried out further on account of the ad<span class='line-break'></span>joining lots, but the lot and addition can be regraded at the same <span class='line-break'> </span>grade as now.

<p>The remains can be received here at any time, and the <span class='line-break'> </span>brick grave prepared for them.

We have no <span class='line-break'> </span>facilities for going outside the cemetery to receive a body, but <span class='line-break'> </span>if the remains come by express they will be delivered here, other<span class='line-break'></span>wise you will have to get some Boston undertaker to receive the <span class='line-break'> </span>body and convey it to this cemetery.</p>
<p>Please have the enclosed order signed by the proprietor <span class='line-break'> </span>and the blanks filled out (the proprietor of the lot in this cem<span class='line-break'></span>etery I mean).  Our State law requires a permit from the Board of <span class='line-break'> </span>Health, or Selectmen of the town from whence the remains are to be <span class='line-break'> </span>removed, this had better be glued to the box and a duplicate mailed<span class='line-break'> </span>to me.</p>

<p>I find that to repair the name plate on the fence of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Rogers lot will cost not over $5.00.  The fund deposited for <span class='line-break'> </span>the care of this lot is smaller than usual, and the interest of it <span class='line-break'> </span>for the coming year will not be enough to give the lot such care <span class='line-break'> </span>as it usually has had and also make this repair to the fence.<span class='line-break'> </span>I will be glad to follow the wishes of the proprietors of the lot <span class='line-break'> </span>in the matter, by either repairing the plate at their expense, or <span class='line-break'> </span>omitting some part of the care for the coming year and making the <span class='line-break'> </span>repair at the expense of the fund.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>Your note is received.  The fence on the lot might be <span class='line-break'> </span>repaired but the expense would be considerable, and as it is rusty <span class='line-break'> </span>and unsightly the appearance of the lot and its surroundings would <span class='line-break'> </span>be improved, and the constant expense of painting avoided by remov<span class='line-break'></span>ing it as very many of our proprietors have done with the fences <span class='line-break'> </span>on their lots.  To do this, remove all the posts but four at the <span class='line-break'> </span>corners, recut those and cut the number of the lot on one of them,<span class='line-break'> </span>fill up and sod over the other post holes, raise a sunken grave and <span class='line-break'> </span>build a foundation under a headstone now out of plumb, with the <span class='line-break'> </span>care of the lot for the year 1889 would cost $10.00 and the old <span class='line-break'> </span>material of the fence.</p>
<p>The care of the lot without plants or topdressing would <span class='line-break'> </span>cost $2.00 a year, as you are abroad I would suggest that an order<span class='line-break'> </span>for the care of the lot until countermanded would keep the grass <span class='line-break'> </span>cut and the lot clean and tidy.</p>

<p>In regard to the enclosed bill, you will remember that<span class='line-break'> </span>in my conversation with you last Summer I said that the myrtle<span class='line-break'> </span>removed from your lot was old and not such as I cared to buy.

<p>The charge for the work was clearly agreed upon.

<p>The sum needed for the perpetual care of your lot, inclu<span class='line-break'></span>ding the sod and the cleaning but not the renewal of the monument<span class='line-break'> </span>and without plants or myrtle will be $350.00.

If you propose to have the usual quantity of plants in<span class='line-break'> </span>the North border only, an additional sum of $100.00 will be needed,<span class='line-break'> </span>or if you wish to have the usual number of plants in the North and<span class='line-break'> </span>East borders, that is the border on Eagle ave. as well as that on<span class='line-break'> </span>Spruce ave., the additional amount needed will be $200.00.

<p>Dear Sirs:-</p>
<p>In regard to your enquiry as to the Hon. H.H.

The rise from the path to the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>will not be over nine inches. The width of the front of the lot<span class='line-break'> </span>is twelve feet, and I need hardly remind you that the extreme width<span class='line-break'> </span>of the entrance posts, steps and buttresses must not exceed half<span class='line-break'> </span>that width, that is six feet, and that border stones are not per<span class='line-break'></span>missible. The depth of the underground roots of the corner posts<span class='line-break'> </span>should not be less than five feet. A post that only goes below<span class='line-break'> </span>the frost line is not considered of proper depth, as graves are<span class='line-break'> </span>made close to these posts and any sinking of the grave is followed<span class='line-break'> </span>by the tipping of the post, unless it reaches as far as the<span class='line-break'> </span>bottom of the grave.</p>

<p>S.A. Denio, Esq.,<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Your note is received. I have no doubt that the salvia<span class='line-break'> </span>is the plant you have in mind, as there are a large number of them<span class='line-break'> </span>used in the cemetery. It is not a shrub however, but an annual<span class='line-break'> </span>plant that has to be set out each year. As it only blooms a<span class='line-break'> </span>portion of the season, I hardly think that you would be satisfied<span class='line-break'> </span>with that alone, and our practice is to set it out with a variety<span class='line-break'> </span>of mixed plants so that there may be a continuation of blooms thr[sic]-<span class='line-break'> </span>ought the season. Under ordinary circumstances if the contract<span class='line-break'> </span>was made for plants in the Spruce avenue border only, there would<span class='line-break'> </span>be from two to four salvias set out with the other plants, but of<span class='line-break'> </span>course if you desired more of it your wish would be attended to<span class='line-break'> </span>whenever the plant could be got. I am sorry that being only an<span class='line-break'> </span>annual plant there is none of it to be seen here at present.</p>

<p>Your note of 6th inst. is received. The tombs referred<span class='line-break'> </span>to in our annual report are the single compartment tombs with a<span class='line-break'> </span>door above ground where several bodies are placed in this single<span class='line-break'> </span>compartment, in distinction to those in which each body is placed<span class='line-break'> </span>in a separate sealed compartment.</p>
<p>Brick graves and underground tombs being covered with<span class='line-break'> </span>earth are not objected to, and the present rule in this cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>is, that all tombs that may be built with a door above ground are<span class='line-break'> </span>required to be so constructed that each body is placed in a sepa<span class='line-break'></span>rate compartment, which is hermetically sealed <u>at the time of the</u><span class='line-break'> </span><u>interment</u>.

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your note is received.  The price of lots in this cem<span class='line-break'></span>etery is from $2.25 to $ 2.75 per foot, but some lots that are<span class='line-break'> </span>exceptionally situated are sold at lower and higher rates.<span class='line-break'> </span>price is for the lot all prepred, marked at the coners with gran<span class='line-break'></span>ite post set level with the sod and numbers, and the perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care of the lot is included,</p>
<p>As the lots are all sold under perpetual care it has <span class='line-break'> </span>this year been decided to sell no more singles graves except with<span class='line-break'> </span>a provision for their perpetual care, so they are new sold at the <span class='line-break'> </span>uniform rate of $ 25.00, and if a second interment is made $ 10.00<span class='line-break'> </span>more and the interments fee ($ 5.00 )  in addition in each case. No<span class='line-break'> </span>more than two interments are permitted in the grave, nor is any<span class='line-break'> </span>distinction made except as to the interment fee whether for an <span class='line-break'> </span>adult or for a child.</p>

<p>Dear Sr :-</p>
<p>Your note is received. Marble is the material most <span class='line-break'> </span>tensively used for headstone, <span class='line-break'> </span>better class of granites.</p>
<p>The foundation should not be built or the stone set until<span class='line-break'> </span>the danger from frost is past.</p>
<p>The underground foundation is prepared by our workmen,<span class='line-break'> </span>and where the Corporation has become responsible for the lot thr<span class='line-break'></span>ough its being under perpetual care, they also set the stone. The<span class='line-break'> </span>order for the foundation with the exact loaction in which it is to<span class='line-break'> </span>be built should be sent to this office two or three weeks before<span class='line-break'> </span>the stone is ready to set.</p>
<p>If you will fillout and sign the enclosed blank and for<span class='line-break'></span>ward it to our Sec'y (#5 Pemberton Sq., Boston) he will issue the <span class='line-break'> </span>permit needed for the stonecutter, and will also send you the card<span class='line-break'> </span>of addnission to cemetery.</p>
<p>I enclose you a copy of the latest map issued.</p>

<p>Mrs. C.H. Kettell,<span class='line-break'> </span>Charlestown, Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Madam:-</p>
<p>In regard to the bill for repairs on myrtle in your<span class='line-break'> </span>lot I find that the material had to be carried up a flight of<span class='line-break'> </span>steps, which made the labor a much larger item than it otherwise<span class='line-break'> </span>would have been.</p>
<p>Myrtle is very uncertain, and when we set it out we<span class='line-break'> </span>are expected to renew it without further charge if it dies within<span class='line-break'> </span>the year. I desire to have these charges satisfactory to our<span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors, and if you are willing to relieve the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>of any further responsibility for the myrtle set out, I will<span class='line-break'> </span>divide the charge and make it $3.75.  If you decide to accept this<span class='line-break'> </span>please notify me, that I may send notice of the abatement to<span class='line-break'> </span>our Treasurer.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Supt.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Lot #407 and #408 are enclosed as one lot of triangular<span class='line-break'> </span>shape, by an iron fence.</p>
<p>On account of the peculiar shape of the enclosure, the<span class='line-break'> </span>fence should be removed from both lots at the same time, whenever<span class='line-break'> </span>it is done at all. In each lot there is a large spruce tree the<span class='line-break'> </span>shade from which is so dense that I do not believe it is possible <span class='line-break'> </span>[indecipherable] sod alive immediately under it.</p>
<p>If the fence remains the cost of perpetual care of the <span class='line-break'> </span>sod, the cleaning [of and?] the renewal of one monument, and the<span class='line-break'> </span>painting of the fence while it remains, would be $525.00 (five hun<span class='line-break'></span>dred and twenty five dollars), and if the fence is removed $450.00<span class='line-break'> </span>(four hundred and fifty dollars).</p>

<p>Dear Sir:-</p>
<p>Your note is received, the foundation for the stone just<span class='line-break'> </span>set could not be made in line with the other two except by build<span class='line-break'></span>ing over the box, which of course could not be done. It is built<span class='line-break'> </span>at the end of the grave as ordered. The others are without found<span class='line-break'></span>ations, and it is a simple matter to move them up in line with the<span class='line-break'> </span>one just set. If you desire this done please let me know.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Supt.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>I find that the earth pressure behind the top step has <span class='line-break'> </span>moved it out of place.  If [illegible] with iron clamps it would stay <span class='line-break'> </span>in place longer but all stone work of this character has to be re<span class='line-break'></span>set from time to time.  To reset and lead the step and secure it <span class='line-break'> </span>in this way will cost $10.00 (ten dollars).  A [illegible] hasp for the <span class='line-break'> </span>gate will cost $2.00 (two dollars).</p>
<p>The fence is quite rusty and needs to be scraped and <span class='line-break'> </span>repainted.</p>
<p>The appearance of the lot would be improved by removing <span class='line-break'> </span>the fence which can be done, the corner posts recut and the number <span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot cut for the old materials.</p>

<p>Your note of 2nd. is received.  The grave of John Phelps<span class='line-break'> </span>Putnam is not in the position indicated on your diagram, but at <span class='line-break'> </span>the rear of the lot in a line with the other graves.  It may be <span class='line-break'> </span>that you wish this stone placed at the end of grave nearest the <span class='line-break'> </span>path, but the foundation has been built at the other end in line <span class='line-break'> </span>with other stones as my letter of July 23rd notified you would<span class='line-break'> </span>be done and [illegible] you ordererd to the contrary.  I will wait until I <span class='line-break'> </span>hear from you before placing the stone in position.</p>
<p>In the absence of any instructions the Jones monument was <span class='line-break'> </span>not in the usual way with the family name towards the avenue.  Am I <span class='line-break'> </span>to understand from the drawing now sent that you wish it taken down<span class='line-break'> </span>and turned?</p>
<p>I would suggest that detailed instructions be sent for <span class='line-break'> </span>the erection of all work and for the building of foundations even <span class='line-break'> </span>when it seems apparent how the stone should be set, so that delays <span class='line-break'> </span>and mistakes may be avoided.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:-</p>
<p>Five hundred and twenty five dollars the amount original<span class='line-break'></span>ly named to you for the perpetual care of the Cushing lot #3740,<span class='line-break'> </span>included six dollars worth of plants annually, which would supply <span class='line-break'> </span>usually aboaut four dozen of the varieties generally used.</p>
<p>You can judge how many you want better than I can, but <span class='line-break'> </span>I should think that an increase of from seventy five to one hun<span class='line-break'></span>dred and twenty five dollars would provide a sufficiently large<span class='line-break'> </span>number of mixed plants.</p>
<p>This would make the amount to be paid either six or sev<span class='line-break'></span>ven hundred dollars as you prefer, and the agreement would be for <span class='line-break'> </span>nine or thirteen dollars worth of mixed plants, according to the <span class='line-break'> </span>amount paid, without any agreement to ribbon the beds.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>The perpetual care of lot #4229 including the care of the <span class='line-break'> </span>sod, the two myrtle graves now on the lot, the cleaning and leading <span class='line-break'> </span>of the granite curbing and the cleaning but not the renewal of the <span class='line-break'> </span>marble sarcophagus will cost $750.00 (seven hundred and fifty dol<span class='line-break'></span>lars), with plants; for plants in the borders $100.00 (  one hun<span class='line-break'></span>dred dollars) additional; for filling and watering vase $100.00 (one hun<span class='line-break'></span>dred dollars) additional, if the two myrtle graves are removed $50.[sic]<span class='line-break'> </span>(fifty dollars) less.  If the renewal of the monument when necessar<span class='line-break'></span>ary is also included, three hundred dollars additional.</p>
<p>In regard to the monumenat the trimming or entire removal <span class='line-break'> </span>of one tree will improve matters but little as a monument elaborate<span class='line-break'> </span>ly carved, collects the dirt and dust very fast even when not ex<span class='line-break'></span>posed to the dripping from the trees.  The trees have grown together<span class='line-break'> </span>so long, that the removal of one would leave the other unshapely<span class='line-break'> </span>[illegible]  monument can be cleaned for twenty dollars, but the <span class='line-break'> </span>marble has suffered considerably from exposure to the weather, and <span class='line-break'> </span>cannot be made to look like a new one, though it can be considera<span class='line-break'></span>bly improved.</p>

<p>Wm. C. Newell. Esq.<span class='line-break'> </span>#149 Broad St., Boston.</p>
<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>In reply to your favor of Aug. 8th. I would say that at <span class='line-break'> </span>each corner of the curbing either a sufficient foundation should be <span class='line-break'> </span>built, or else the stringers should rest on a post with flat top <span class='line-break'> </span>and base, extending down six feet below the surface, to avoid as far <span class='line-break'> </span>as possible any danger from undermining when any excavation is made<span class='line-break'> </span>in the lot.</p>
<p>If each side is in one piece as it should be, no support<span class='line-break'> </span>between the corners is generally needed.  If, as I understand your<span class='line-break'> </span>plan, it is proposed to show seven or eight inches of curbing above<span class='line-break'> </span>the present sod line, and to raise the sod inside of the curbing <span class='line-break'> </span>three or four inches to the level of the step, there is no objec<span class='line-break'></span>tion to the plan, if you prefer to have an enclosure about the lot,<span class='line-break'> </span>but I cannot forbear calling your attention to the fact that more <span class='line-break'> </span>curbings are being removed, then put around the lots, and that the <span class='line-break'> </span>indications are very strong that within a short time, the stone<span class='line-break'> </span>enclosures will be removed as rapidly as the iron fences have been.</p>
<p>The cost of setting the curbing including the loam need<span class='line-break'></span>ed to raise the sod would be $50.00 (fifty dollars) and the resodd<span class='line-break'></span>fng as already written you $48.00 more, or $30.00 (thirty dollars)<span class='line-break'> </span>for seeding; as the lot is sunken, the sod at the back is of no use.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<div class="page-content">
<p>732</p>
<p>If the lot is seeded and the seed does not come up it <span class='line-break'> </span>would be resown any time needed within a year.</p>
<p>If you decidd to seed the lot, it will be taken under<span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care at the same rate provided  you are willing to wait <span class='line-break'> </span>for the seed to grow into a good sod, which may take some time.</p>
<p>The cost of perpetual care of the lot, in its present<span class='line-break'> </span>condition, including the raising of that portion of the lot now <span class='line-break'> </span>sunken as well as the entire care of the sod, and including also <span class='line-break'> </span>the cleaning but not the renewal of the monument and marker now on <span class='line-break'> </span>lot, will be $325.00 (three hundred and twenty five dollars) with<span class='line-break'></span>out plants; add for each grave covered with myrtle twenty five dol<span class='line-break'></span>lars, and for plants one hundred dollars or more.</p>
<p>If the lot is enclosed with granite according to the <span class='line-break'> </span>plan proposed, it will add to the cost of perpetual care from two <span class='line-break'> </span>to three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>Your message as to the Warren monument left at the front<span class='line-break'> </span>gate is received, but I am not sure as to what is desired.  If the <span class='line-break'> </span>lower stone is to be taken down and rehammered again, full written<span class='line-break'> </span>instructions should be sent, and if the present slope of the stone <span class='line-break'> </span>is satisfactory that should be stated so that the stone may be ce<span class='line-break'></span>mented to the foundation when returned by the stonecutter without<span class='line-break'> </span>further delay.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>When I went <span class='line-break'> </span>in the Bourne tomb with you,<span class='line-break'> </span>to examine the roof and the <span class='line-break'> </span>tiler, you certainly did<span class='line-break'> </span>request that the coffins be <span class='line-break'> </span>protected from the eyes of the <span class='line-break'> </span>curious while the tomb was <span class='line-break'> </span>open, by a covering of boards.</p>
<p>After that, however, I received <span class='line-break'> </span>a message ([?] W<sup>m</sup> Pope I think)<span class='line-break'> </span>asking tht a rough board veti<span class='line-break'></span>bule be put up, and on men<span class='line-break'></span>tioning what you have said<span class='line-break'> </span>about the coming of the coffins<span class='line-break'> </span>I was told the vestibule was what<span class='line-break'> </span>was wanted &amp; I understood that<span class='line-break'> </span>it was to take the place of the covering.</p>
<p>I regret that there should have <span class='line-break'> </span>been any istake in crrying <span class='line-break'> </span>out your wishes, as special <span class='line-break'> </span>[?] have been taken to have<span class='line-break'> </span>them carried out to the letter.</p>
<p>The tiling has been relaid <span class='line-break'> </span>where thrown, and is now in <span class='line-break'> </span>asgood order I think, as possible <span class='line-break'> </span>with the present tiles, and the <span class='line-break'> </span>leading has been repaired.<span class='line-break'> </span>Do you wish the vestibule to remain longer?</p>

<p>It would improve the appearance of the lot to remove <span class='line-break'> </span>the curbing around it and the border stones next the avenue, leav<span class='line-break'></span>ing only the entrance posts and the posts that mark the boundaries.</p>

<p>The iron fence, rusty vase and shrubs in the border of <span class='line-break'> </span>your lot can be removed, the four posts at the corners recut, the <span class='line-break'> </span>other posts removed and the number of the lot cut for the old <span class='line-break'> </span>material.  The whole lot can be regraded the best of the sod placed <span class='line-break'> </span>on the outside border, the lot proper, sown with grass seed and the <span class='line-break'> </span>stones cleaned for $32.00 (thirty two dollars).  If new sod is <span class='line-break'> </span>used for the border and the lot sown with seed the cost would be <span class='line-break'> </span>$38.00 (thirty eight dollars) and if the work is done withut <span class='line-break'> </span>removing the fence the cost will be $4.00 (four dollars) more in <span class='line-break'> </span>either case.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>From your note it would seem that the monument to Judge <span class='line-break'> </span>Putnam is expected to stand nearly in the centre of the lot, and <span class='line-break'> </span>at the same time be nearly at the head of his grave, which on ac<span class='line-break'></span>count of the position of the grave is impossible.  The grave is <span class='line-break'> </span>opposite the steps but at the extreme rear of the lot, and if the<span class='line-break'> </span>monument is placed at the head of the grave it will be opposite the <span class='line-break'> </span>steps but at the extreme back of the lot;  if placed in the centre<span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot, it will be at the foot of Judge Putnam's grave.  I re<span class='line-break'></span>gret to trouble you in the matter, but as the foundation has been <span class='line-break'> </span>built according to instructions at the head of the grave, and next <span class='line-break'> </span>to Katherine's stone, it is desireable if there is a mistake to <span class='line-break'> </span>correct it now.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>The annual payment of $12.00 (twelve dollars) made by <span class='line-break'> </span>Capt. Allen has been for cutting the grass and plants in vases,<span class='line-break'> </span>but did not include any repairs to sod, myrtle or steps, nor the <span class='line-break'> </span>cleaning of the stonework, for all of which an additional expendi<span class='line-break'></span>ture will be needed from time to time if the lot is to be kept in <span class='line-break'> </span>good order.</p>
<p>Six hundred dollars will be received as a Donation in <span class='line-break'> </span>Trust and the income spent in keeping the lot in order as far as <span class='line-break'> </span>it proves sufficient, but without any agreement on the part of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation the income will be sufficieint.</p>
<p>If a contract with guaranty for the perpetual care of the <span class='line-break'> </span>lot is desired, the sum can only be reduced by dispensing with the <span class='line-break'> </span>flowers or myrtle.</p>
<p>The differencae between the two forms of contract amounts<span class='line-break'> </span>to this, that where the money is paid as a Donation in Trust, the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation has no liability beond spending the income faithfully <span class='line-break'> </span>but where it is paid for perpetual care with guaranty, the Corpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion assumes the risk of all changes in the rate of interest, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the price of labor and water also needed to keep the lot in order.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>I find that it will cost $10.00 (ten dollars) to scrape <span class='line-break'> </span>and paint the fence on your lot with asphalture varnish, and $3.00<span class='line-break'> </span>(three dollars) to refasten the plate with number of lot on it.</p>
<p>From the condition of the fence it does not apepar to <span class='line-break'> </span>me that it is worth this expenditure, and I would suggest that it <span class='line-break'> </span>be removed and all the posts but those at the corners, these four <span class='line-break'> </span>rehammered and the number of the lot cut on one of them, which can <span class='line-break'> </span>be done for the old material.</p>
<p>To raise and resod the sunken graves level with the rest <span class='line-break'> </span>of the lot will cost $7.00 (seven dollars), but the whole sod is so <span class='line-break'> </span>poor that I do not think anything less than the renewal of the <span class='line-break'> </span>whole sodding would improe the appearance.</p>

<p>The perpetual care of the Phillip's lot #2404 including <span class='line-break'> </span>the care and renewal of the structures on the lot is worth four <span class='line-break'> </span>thousand dollars.</p>

<p>As I understand it the coffins are now placed on shelves <span class='line-break'> </span>and can probably be picked up, so as to come within the spirit<span class='line-break'> </span>of the vote.</p>
<p>There are several small breaks on the post and buttresses <span class='line-break'> </span>and in making his estimate the immediate renewal of thes pieces <span class='line-break'> </span>was not contemplated.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>Your note of Oct. 1st. has been forwarded by Mr. Mackin<span class='line-break'></span>tosh to me, for answer.  The charge you pay for the care of the lot <span class='line-break'> </span>does not include any special repairs such as the lot needs at pres<span class='line-break'></span>sent.  The main trouble seems to be the stains on the marble ston<span class='line-break'></span>es, caused by two large trees in the lot.  To clean these would cost <span class='line-break'> </span>$7.50 (seven dollars and fifty cents).</p>
<p>The stone marked Lemuel &amp; Sarah Williams appears to be <span class='line-break'> </span>without a proper foundation under it, but build one and reset the <span class='line-break'> </span>stone would cost $16.00 (sixteen dollars).  To only plum the stone<span class='line-break'> </span>would cost $3.00 (three dollars).</p>
<p>Some patching of the sod is needed which would cost $4.00<span class='line-break'> </span>(four dollars)</p>

<p>Before a removal is made, an order signed by a majority <span class='line-break'> </span>of the heirs (if not owned by one person) of the lot from which the <span class='line-break'> </span>remains are to be taken and by theproprietor of the new lot, has <span class='line-break'> </span>to be sent here, and the location of the grave in the new lot should<span class='line-break'> </span>be exactly designated by diagram or otherwise.</p>
<p>The amount needed for the perpetual care of a lot would <span class='line-break'> </span>depend on its situation etc. so that I would need to know the par<span class='line-break'></span>ticular lot before an estimate is made.</p>

There are too small places where the sodding does <span class='line-break'> </span>not fully cover up the joint of the granite front of the tomb,.<span class='line-break'> </span>Is it this or something inside the tomb you wish pointed up?</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>The reason why the estimate is so large is that the sodd<span class='line-break'></span>ing today is in bad order and to bring the lot into good shape a <span class='line-break'> </span>considerable outlay is needed.</p>
<p>$300.00 (three hundred dollars) will be enough for the <span class='line-break'> </span>perpetual care of the sod, the cleaning but not the renewal of the <span class='line-break'> </span>headstones and two dozen plants in borders provided you make the <span class='line-break'> </span>payment this month.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>The brown-stone posts under the fence are in very poor condi<span class='line-break'></span>tion, and unless replaced soon, the fence must be removed.  They <span class='line-break'> </span>should be replaced, if at all, with a more durable stone, which <span class='line-break'> </span>would make it necessary to replace all the stonework, the expense of <span class='line-break'> </span>which would be entirely out of proprotion to the results obtained.</p>
<p>Contracts are not made for the perpetual care of less than a <span class='line-break'> </span>whole lot, but after the lot has been arranged as desired you can pro<span class='line-break'></span>bably come to soem understanding with the owner of the other art,<span class='line-break'> </span>so that the perpetual care of teh whole can be provided for.</p>
<p>To regrade and sod the whole enclosure would cost one hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>and forty dollars ($140.00) and to regrade and sod one half of it <span class='line-break'> </span>would cost eighty dollars ($80.00).  If the whole lot were regraded<span class='line-break'> </span>and sown with grass seed the expense would be seventy dollars ($70.00)<span class='line-break'> </span>or forty dollars ($40.00) for half teh lot and although you would <span class='line-break'> </span>have to wait longer, our experience is that the results are fully as <span class='line-break'> </span>good.  The grass will not grow well under the two trees that remain,<span class='line-break'> </span>but until the room is needed for interments, I think it would be a <span class='line-break'> </span>pity to remove them.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: -</p>
<p>Your message given at the gate office is received.  Will <span class='line-break'> </span>you please tell me on which lot you wished the estimate made, your <span class='line-break'> </span>own lot #2833, or the Mentzer lot #2560, and just what you desire <span class='line-break'> </span>done, as there seems to be some misunderstanding about the matter.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Sup't.</p>

<p>Mrs. M. A. Adams,<span class='line-break'> </span>Melrose Highlands, Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Madam: -</p>
<p>The workmen have gone over the two marble stones again <span class='line-break'> </span>and the green moss has been taken off, but I do not think they can be<span class='line-break'> </span>made to look much better.  The lot has been liberally top-dressed.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Sup't.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. H. Laughlin,<span class='line-break'> </span>#1943 Locust St., Phil., Penn.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>Your note to our Treasurer has been forwarded to me for <span class='line-break'> </span>answer.  The bounds in your lot are irregular in shape, but outside<span class='line-break'> </span>of that the turf is in fair condition.  If the mounds were made<span class='line-break'> </span>flat the turf would be in nearly as good condition as new sod would <span class='line-break'> </span>make it.  The granite curbing is very much out of place, and <span class='line-break'> </span>I would sugfgest that it have attention fiarst.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Sup't.</p>
