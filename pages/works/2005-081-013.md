<p>My Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am obliged to you for <span class='line-break'> </span>the opportunity of reading your <span class='line-break'> </span>historical account of Mount Auburn; <span class='line-break'> </span>It is lucid, neat &amp; sufficient.  I do not <span class='line-break'> </span>perceive that any thing should be added <span class='line-break'> </span>or struck out, on the principles you <span class='line-break'> </span>have acted upon, &amp; to which I [give/pick/put?] my a<span class='line-break'> </span>ssent.</p>
