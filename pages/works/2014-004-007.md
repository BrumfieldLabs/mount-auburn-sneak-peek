<p>The committee to whom was refered the <span class='line-break'> </span>subject of the receiving tomb under Park Street<span class='line-break'> </span>Church visited the tomb with Mr Baker, the <span class='line-break'> </span>Sexton of that church, who informed them that <span class='line-break'> </span>for the eight years he had been in charge fifteen <span class='line-break'> </span>bodies had received into the tomb, &amp; sixteen had <span class='line-break'> </span>been removed from it, leaving one less than<sup>the</sup>num<span class='line-break'></span>ber in it, when he took charge of the tomb.</p>
<p>He has charged for his own services in opening &amp; light<span class='line-break'></span>ing the premises for the reception of a body one dollar <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; a half; and for delivering[?] one dollar each - He does <span class='line-break'> </span>not know if any other charge, nor to whom it was paid,<span class='line-break'> </span>if any fee has been demanded.  He did not know <span class='line-break'> </span>who owned the tomb, but supposed the M<sup>t</sup> Auburn Cem<span class='line-break'> </span>etery owned one half, &amp; Mr Smith, the sexton of the<span class='line-break'> </span>"Stone chapel," the other half; as he occasionally made <span class='line-break'> </span>use of it.  The com<sup>e</sup> subsequently saw Mr. Smith, who<span class='line-break'> </span>stated that a <u>Mr Beale</u> was the owner of the other half;<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; that his body<u>had</u>been deposited there, &amp; recently remov<span class='line-break'></span>ed thence to M<sup>t</sup>Auburn.  It does not appear<span class='line-break'> </span>that any specified time, that a body may remain,<span class='line-break'> </span>has been fixed;  nor that any individiual has charge <span class='line-break'> </span>of the tomb.  But an order from any trustees, or <span class='line-break'> </span>from the City's Superintendent of Burying grounds has <span class='line-break'> </span>has always been respected &amp; obeyed<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>The com<sup>e</sup> did not learn that any body, deposited <span class='line-break'> </span>by the authority of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn Cemetery, remained <span class='line-break'> </span>in the tomb, except that of Mr. Lilly, the former partner <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mr W<sup>m</sup>Wells.  But a full examination would <span class='line-break'> </span>shortly be made, &amp; a report of all that remained <span class='line-break'> </span>in the tomb would be furnished the Trustees.</p>
<p>The com<sup>e</sup> inquired of Mr Smith<sup>what</sup>was the value of <span class='line-break'> </span>the tomb, &amp; he replied "nothing."</p>
<p>Therefore, as there is no inducement to attempt<span class='line-break'> </span>a sale of <sup>the</sup>tomb, &amp; as the possession is attended <span class='line-break'> </span>with no expense, &amp; may be useful in cases of <span class='line-break'> </span>very deep or drifted snow, rendering access to <span class='line-break'> </span>Mt Auburn difficult, the Comm<sup>e</sup> would sug<span class='line-break'></span>gest the propriety of placing the name of M<sup>t</sup>Aub<span class='line-break'></span>urn Cemetery<sup>over</sup>the door, of fixing a time which a <span class='line-break'> </span>body may remain in the tomb &amp; of appointing <span class='line-break'> </span>the sexton of the church, who has the keys, or some<span class='line-break'> </span>other suitable person, to take charge of the tomb<span class='line-break'> </span>It would seem advisable also that the remains <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mr Lilly be removed to a permanent resting <span class='line-break'> </span>place.</p>
