<div class="page-content">
<p>BOSTON, Sept. 2, 1878.</p>
<p>EDITOR CAMBRIDGE TRIBUNE: Permit me to <span class='line-break'> </span>call your attention to the two suggestions which, if <span class='line-break'> </span>adopted at Mount Auburn, would undoubtedly be <span class='line-break'> </span>highly appreciated by the thousands of visitors to <span class='line-break'> </span>that beautiful cemetery. The first suggestion is <span class='line-break'> </span>that iron settees or benches be placed at conve- <span class='line-break'> </span>nient distances on the various avenues. Although <span class='line-break'> </span>at present a few are provided, yet compared with <span class='line-break'> </span>Forest Hills Cemetery the contrast in regard to <span class='line-break'> </span>this convenience is very noticeable. The other <span class='line-break'> </span>suggestion is, the adoption of carriage conveyance, <span class='line-break'> </span>such as is provided at Greenwood Cemetery in <span class='line-break'> </span>Brooklyn, where carriages similar to those in use <span class='line-break'> </span>at Central Park, convery passengers, for a small <span class='line-break'> </span>fee, through a circuit comprising the most attrac- <span class='line-break'> </span>tive avenues, checks being given for stopping off <span class='line-break'> </span>at any point, only one fee being required for the <span class='line-break'> </span>entire circuit. This convenience would, if adopted <span class='line-break'> </span>at Mount Auburn, undoubtedly meet with the gen- <span class='line-break'> </span>uine approval and patronage of the proprietors <span class='line-break'> </span>and their friends as well as the numerous strangers <span class='line-break'> </span>who are attracted there. As there can apparently <span class='line-break'> </span>be no reasonable objection to the adoption of this <span class='line-break'> </span>special convenience at Mount Auburn, I hope the <span class='line-break'> </span>suggestion may at least be duly considered by the <span class='line-break'> </span>officers of that corporation.                       C. T. D.</p>
<p>We trust that the words of our friend will re- <span class='line-break'> </span>ceive attention from the powers that be. They <span class='line-break'> </span>are timely suggestions, and should be carried out <span class='line-break'> </span>at once. - [ED. TRIBUNE.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
