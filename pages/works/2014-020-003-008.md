<p>Dear <a href='/pages/subjects/58078' title='Lovering, James W.'>Mr. Lovering</a>,</p>
<p>Have you ever<span class='line-break'> </span>considered the case of <sup>my aunt</sup> Mrs.<span class='line-break'> </span>Worcester's lot, <a href='/pages/subjects/81801' title='Lot 582'><!--Lot-->582</a>, <a href='/pages/subjects/61124' title='Aster Path'>Aster <span class='line-break'> </span>Path</a>? I believe I <span class='line-break'> </span>wrote you about the <span class='line-break'> </span><u>shrubs</u> there. One of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Kalmias, the one in <span class='line-break'> </span>the S.W. cor., has died,<span class='line-break'> </span>and Mrs. Worcester would<span class='line-break'> </span>like very much to have <span class='line-break'> </span>it replaced.</p>
