<p>Dear Sirs.<span class='line-break'> </span>In <date when='1877-12'>December<span class='line-break'> </span>of 1877</date>. I planted on my dear <span class='line-break'> </span>Boy's grave at Mt. Auburn/<a href='/pages/subjects/93173' title='Lot 1454'>Lot <span class='line-break'> </span><u>1454</u></a>./ One hundred choice Tulip <span class='line-break'> </span>bulbs, every one of which bloomed <span class='line-break'> </span>the next May - and were left to<span class='line-break'> </span>dry off. I planting in the spaces<span class='line-break'> </span>between strong roots of periwinkle<span class='line-break'> </span>to take their place. <u>This</u> spring,<span class='line-break'> </span>in May, when I visited the spot<span class='line-break'> </span>not a single Tulip was to be <span class='line-break'> </span>found, nor the slightest trace <span class='line-break'> </span>of one, not even a bulblet, or<span class='line-break'> </span>vestige of outside skin. Show-</p>
<p>[last page: out of order, pg 4 of 4]<span class='line-break'> </span>and dell periwinkle at that <span class='line-break'> </span>rate, the Corporation ought <span class='line-break'> </span>to know it. And there is great<span class='line-break'> </span>complaint. I know that one man<span class='line-break'> </span>in the employ there was very <span class='line-break'> </span>dishonest. If their hands could have <span class='line-break'> </span>been employed in removing the<span class='line-break'> </span>rubbish of stone work for which<span class='line-break'> </span>service I paid a large bill at your<span class='line-break'> </span>office, and then had to send my <span class='line-break'> </span>man to remove it, it would square<span class='line-break'> </span>more nicely with justice. The Lot <span class='line-break'> </span>has never been cared for, in any pro<span class='line-break'></span>portion to what I have yearly paid</p>
<p>Can I have any redress, or protection<span class='line-break'> </span>from this vandalism? My son<span class='line-break'> </span>who takes this to you, will add his <span class='line-break'> </span>testimony, also further statements.</p>

Mice, and<span class='line-break'> </span>squirrels, would not have done their<span class='line-break'> </span>work so thoroughly, and if they<span class='line-break'> </span>did not meddle with them the<span class='line-break'> </span>first year, why should they the<span class='line-break'> </span>second? This is not all. The<span class='line-break'> </span>Perriwinkle is constantly being<span class='line-break'> </span>robbed from my husband's<span class='line-break'> </span>grave. This Spring, I found<span class='line-break'> </span>only a few scattering roots upon<span class='line-break'> </span>it, and went over, set out, with<span class='line-break'> </span>my own hands, more than a<span class='line-break'> </span>hundred good roots; my man<span class='line-break'> </span>carrying with him, excellent<span class='line-break'> </span>composte to secure a vigerous<span class='line-break'> </span>growth. The other graves in the</p>
<p>[right page]<span class='line-break'> </span>lot, were refitted in the same<span class='line-break'> </span>manner, or account of similar loss.</p>
<p>My man watered it abundantly,<span class='line-break'> </span>and fine rains followed. Owing<span class='line-break'> </span>to illness, I have not been able<span class='line-break'> </span>to visit the spot until yesterday<span class='line-break'> </span>when to my increased annoyance<span class='line-break'> </span>I found the Periwinkle I had<span class='line-break'> </span>set with so much pains, all cut<span class='line-break'> </span>away, and the same bare space of<span class='line-break'> </span>dreary earth, all around the<span class='line-break'> </span>graves. Besides it had been<span class='line-break'> </span>thinned-out, to meagreness, on<span class='line-break'> </span>the top. and had also been cut,<span class='line-break'> </span>for <u>cuttings</u>. A Lady told me<span class='line-break'> </span>she paid a gardener at Mt<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn <u>Seven Dollars</u>, for a<span class='line-break'> </span>very sparse covering of Periwinkle<span class='line-break'> </span>for <u>two graves</u>.
