<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>I was very <span class='line-break'> </span>sorry to have so very few<span class='line-break'> </span>moments in which to see you.<span class='line-break'> </span>I am able to go but very <span class='line-break'> </span>seldom to Mt. Auburn and <span class='line-break'> </span>wanted to speak to you <span class='line-break'> </span>of one or two things connected <span class='line-break'> </span>with our lot there.</p>
<p>I went from here on <date when='1879-08-27'>Aug. 27th</date>—<span class='line-break'> </span>an anniversary—and carried</p>
<p>[sideways page left]</p>
<p>know that the little work to be <span class='line-break'> </span>done on the little baby's grave <span class='line-break'> </span>has been attended to. It is a grief<span class='line-break'> </span>to me to live so far from the<span class='line-break'> </span>resting place of my dear children.</p>
<p>Yours with regard</p>

<p>some fresh flowers and <span class='line-break'> </span>a little cross of imortelles<span class='line-break'> </span>and placed all these.<span class='line-break'> </span>I was greatly grieved to <span class='line-break'> </span>find on re-visiting the<span class='line-break'> </span>spot the other day that all had been<span class='line-break'> </span>taken away.

There is no reason<span class='line-break'> </span>why the wreath should not be <span class='line-break'> </span>there through the Winter's snows,<span class='line-break'> </span>but I cannot now help having <span class='line-break'> </span>the feeling that what I carried—<span class='line-break'> </span>going from all this distance—<span class='line-break'> </span>to put there myself, is probably <span class='line-break'> </span>already taken away.</p>
