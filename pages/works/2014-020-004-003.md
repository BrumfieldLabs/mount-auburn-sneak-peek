<p>Subject: Handwriting [in pencil]</p>
<p>Ordered [underlined]<span class='line-break'> </span>Exchange [underlined]</p>
<p>Supt -- Mt Auburn Cemetery.</p>
<p>Bids for flowers were made<span class='line-break'> </span>in Lot 72 in the summer of 1878<span class='line-break'> </span>without any order being given for<span class='line-break'> </span>the same --</p>
<p>On inquiry at your office I found no<span class='line-break'> </span>line was drawn through "Usual no. of Plants."<span class='line-break'> </span>on the order for the year. I said it was <span class='line-break'> </span>a mistake, and requested the [beds?] might<span class='line-break'> </span>be re sodded in the autumn.</p>
<p>Last summer on visiting the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>I found the work had not been done -<span class='line-break'></span>I again request it to be done this spring<span class='line-break'> </span>and if it is right I should have a bill<span class='line-break'> </span>for the same, it will be paid.</p>
<p>Mary A Wright<span class='line-break'> </span>Abington, Mass.</p>
<p>Mch. 15^th^ '80</p>
