<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Allow me to <span class='line-break'> </span>trouble you for some information<span class='line-break'> </span>on the following subject. It<span class='line-break'> </span>frequently happens that a party<span class='line-break'> </span>owning a lot get it graded sodded<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp;c. put in nice condition and leave<span class='line-break'> </span>money for its perpetual care.<span class='line-break'> </span>After this same Granite man<span class='line-break'> </span>Erects a monument &amp;c. and in<span class='line-break'> </span>doing so destroys the lot and<span class='line-break'> </span>grass which has to be regraded<span class='line-break'> </span>and sodded. Who is the <span class='line-break'> </span>proper party to pay for this<span class='line-break'> </span>work and how to you manage<span class='line-break'> </span>in Mt. Auburn, My own idea</p>

<p>is that we should look to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Granite Man as he is the one that<span class='line-break'> </span>injured the appearance of the <span class='line-break'> </span>lot and as it is under purpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care it seems to me that we<span class='line-break'> </span>should not wait for orders to<span class='line-break'> </span>restore the lot to its proper<span class='line-break'> </span>condition. But the granite<span class='line-break'> </span>man says grading lots is not<span class='line-break'> </span>his business and it was not<span class='line-break'> </span>in his contract as this work<span class='line-break'> </span>is constantly being done. I am<span class='line-break'> </span>anxious to know who is<span class='line-break'> </span>responsible for making things<span class='line-break'> </span>right I shall be greatly<span class='line-break'> </span>obliged for your opinion</p>
