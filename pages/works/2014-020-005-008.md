<p>Mr. O. D. Dana<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, Mass.<span class='line-break'> </span>Dear Sir,<span class='line-break'> </span>In reply to your favor of the 16th wish will say<span class='line-break'> </span>there is evidently some slight trouble with the Mowers at<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn which they do not exactly understand<span class='line-break'> </span>how to remedy. and we would here suggest that possibly<span class='line-break'> </span>they have not properly oiled. then again they may <span class='line-break'> </span>have the revolving cutter set down on the bed-knife<span class='line-break'> </span>too hard. This is frequently the case where people have<span class='line-break'> </span>been using the [illegible] Mowers as they have to be set<span class='line-break'> </span>close together to work well. The writer expects to be<span class='line-break'> </span>in Boston again in a short time and will there at<span class='line-break'></span>tend  to the matter. But I think if you will convey these<span class='line-break'> </span>suggestions to them they will have no farther trouble<span class='line-break'> </span>Hoping there will be no further trouble we remain<span class='line-break'> </span>Yours truly<span class='line-break'> </span>[Stamp: Charborn &amp; Coldwell M'f'g Co.,<span class='line-break'> </span>By] W. H. Burb[illegible]</p>
