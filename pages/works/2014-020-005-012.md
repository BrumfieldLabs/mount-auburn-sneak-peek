<p>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>Your letter of the 8<sup>th</sup> inst recd. It is<span class='line-break'> </span>raising a great commotion amongst the white Bronze<span class='line-break'> </span>Agts. who have bought this Comity, they say it is a D__n<span class='line-break'> </span>lie, and they propose to get affidavits, denying that<span class='line-break'> </span>their white Bronze monuments are not allowed in<span class='line-break'> </span>your Cemetery. I write you this so that you will<span class='line-break'> </span>know how to take them. I have shewn parties<span class='line-break'> </span>^your letter^ who were persuaded by these [..gts.?] that their ware<span class='line-break'> </span>did not stand as high as they had recommended <span class='line-break'> </span>it. I am much obliged to you for your prompt<span class='line-break'> </span>answer it is a letter that will go far towards<span class='line-break'> </span>counteracting what these tin fellows expected to do.</p>
<p>Yours Truly<span class='line-break'> </span>Louis Zinger</p>
