<p>Subject: The Tower - complaint.</p>
<p>[letterhead: G. E. Richardson<span class='line-break'> </span>803 Main St.<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge, Mass.]</p>
<p>Sep. 19 '81<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent Mt. Auburn Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Dear Sir,<span class='line-break'> </span>I wish to call yor attention to the condition of the interior of "the Tower".  Yesterday morning it had the appearance of not having been swept for a number of days and it had evidently been used as a urinal that very day.  It's condition was such that if I had happened to have had friends with me, - strangers visiting Cambridge especially, - I should have been mortified extremely.  If no methos can be devised to prohibit the committing of nuisances in "the Tower", why not shut it up?</p>
