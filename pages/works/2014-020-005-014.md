<p>Dear <a href='/pages/subjects/58078' title='Lovering, James W.'>Mr Lovering</a>,<span class='line-break'> </span>Some time in the spring of 1879,<span class='line-break'> </span>if I rightly recollect, an old lady got off a<span class='line-break'> </span>horse car, opposite the entrance to your office and<span class='line-break'> </span>started to reach the sidewalk beside the fence.<span class='line-break'> </span>There is an iron rail, square edge, between the<span class='line-break'> </span>road &amp; the sidewalk and being painted dark<span class='line-break'> </span>the same color, as the fence, is difficult to see unless<span class='line-break'> </span>ones eyes are young &amp; bright. the old lady referred to<span class='line-break'> </span>did not see this rail and struck it so hard that<span class='line-break'> </span>she was considerably damaged, being cut on the forehead,<span class='line-break'> </span>I remember dressing the wound, as best I could &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>after plastering it up put her onto a car for home.<span class='line-break'> </span>Last week my mother and another old lady met with<span class='line-break'> </span>a precisely similar accident at the same place<span class='line-break'> </span>and only by good fortune escaped serious harm.<span class='line-break'> </span>Before somebody else is unfortunate in the same way,<span class='line-break'> </span>wouldn't it be advisable that some step be taken<span class='line-break'> </span>to prevent another accident of same kind. Of course<span class='line-break'> </span>it isn't likely that either of these ladies will forget it,<span class='line-break'> </span>so my suggestion is for the benefit of those who</p>

<p>have not had this experience. It is really dangerous,<span class='line-break'> </span>and it would seem against good policy to allow<span class='line-break'> </span>its continuance just as it is -- I hope you understand<span class='line-break'> </span>just my meaning, that I do not wish to meddle with<span class='line-break'> </span>what does not concern me and that my interest in<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn is [lively?]. But for some hours I was very<span class='line-break'> </span>anxious about my mother as it is a very serious<span class='line-break'> </span>matter for one so old to receive so serious a blow,<span class='line-break'> </span>and this is not the first case.</p>
<p>I hope some simple &amp; inexpensive expedient<span class='line-break'> </span>can be arrived at to do away with this danger.</p>
<p>Yrs very truly</p>
