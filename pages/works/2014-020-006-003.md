<p>Subject: "Act" about depth of burials [in pencil]</p>
<p>Mount Hope Cemetery.</p>
<p>Belonging to the CITY OF BOSTON, and situated in the DORCHESTER DISTRICT.<span class='line-break'> </span>TRUSTEES' OFFICE, AT THE CITY REGISTRAR'S OFFICE, CITY HALL, Boston.</p>
<p>Post-Office address of the Superintendent, MATTAPAN, Mass.</p>
<p>March 17, 1882</p>
<p>J.W. Lovering Esq.<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt. M^t^ Auburn Cem.</p>
<p>Dear Sir --</p>
<p>The enclosed "Act",<span class='line-break'> </span>now before the Legislature explains<span class='line-break'> </span>itself. In our Cemetery and Forest<span class='line-break'> </span>Hills the lots and single graves<span class='line-break'> </span>are trenches six feet deep with<span class='line-break'> </span>a view of burying two grown<span class='line-break'> </span>persons in a grave, if the owners<span class='line-break'> </span>wish to, and have three feet of<span class='line-break'> </span>earth over the second interment.</p>
<p>I presume about the same<span class='line-break'> </span>thing is done at M^t^ Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>and all other cemeteries near<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston. If this "Act" becomes<span class='line-break'> </span>the law it will be impossible<span class='line-break'> </span>to make a second interment</p>

<p>in graves now occupied without<span class='line-break'> </span>lowering the bodies, and in<span class='line-break'> </span>most cases that would be impossible<span class='line-break'> </span>for many of our lots are on the <span class='line-break'> </span>ledge and that is blasted out<span class='line-break'> </span>only six feet deep. To bury<span class='line-break'> </span>two bodies in a grave would<span class='line-break'> </span>require at least seven feet in<span class='line-break'> </span>depth if four feet below<span class='line-break'> </span>the level of the ground. We believe<span class='line-break'> </span>it useless to require the bodies to<span class='line-break'> </span>be four feet deep. No odor<span class='line-break'> </span>can get through three feet<span class='line-break'> </span>of earth. It would ^be^ a hardship<span class='line-break'> </span>to the poorer class who have<span class='line-break'> </span>not the means to buy land<span class='line-break'> </span>enough at present price to<span class='line-break'> </span>put only one body in a grave.<span class='line-break'> </span>It would also greatly increase<span class='line-break'> </span>our own expenses if this Act<span class='line-break'> </span>becomes a law.</p>
<p>I have seen Mr. Moulton<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
