<p>OFFICE OF THE<span class='line-break'> </span>BOSTON GAS LIGHT COMPANY,<span class='line-break'> </span>24 WEST STREET, BOSTON, April 10, 1882</p>
<p>[written in left margin]<span class='line-break'> </span>1^25^<span class='line-break'> </span>per foot.<span class='line-break'> </span>Brown has plan [underlined]</p>
<p>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>I wish to make some inqui<span class='line-break'></span>ries about the Whittemore Lot (No. 185, Rose<span class='line-break'> </span>Path) now represented by my wife.</p>
<p>What is its size? 300 [in blue pencil]</p>
<p>Is there not a strip of land adjoining it<span class='line-break'> </span>which belongs to the corporation, and which<span class='line-break'> </span>can be used for enlarging it?</p>
<p>If so, how much land?</p>
<p>In the original survey, or in setting out<span class='line-break'> </span>the hedge, there was some mistake made, so<span class='line-break'> </span>there was at one time such a strip.</p>
<p>My wife, who is in London, where our only<span class='line-break'> </span>son died on Saturday, knows better than her<span class='line-break'> </span>sisters about the facts in the case; but it is de<span class='line-break'></span>sirable to ascertain what can be done before her<span class='line-break'> </span>return.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>Ch^s^ C. Smith.</p>
<p>Mr Brown please look up --</p>
