<p>Subject: How much the Society would care to pay. [in pencil]</p>

<p>Sir</p>
<p>[A^t^? [About?]] four days ago I looked at<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot of the Scots Charitable Society,<span class='line-break'> </span>my attention having been particularly<span class='line-break'> </span>called to it at this time [from?]<span class='line-break'> </span>letter in regard to the necessity of<span class='line-break'> </span>fixing the [tomb?]; and it seemed to<span class='line-break'> </span>me that the surface of the ground<span class='line-break'> </span>was in rather bad shape generally;<span class='line-break'> </span>and as if the grass had not been<span class='line-break'> </span>cut for a long time. I have by this<span class='line-break'> </span>mail sent a note to Mr Maitland<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to this subject, and [I can?]<span class='line-break'> </span>confer with him in regard to the whole<span class='line-break'> </span>matter. Or if I knew what afternoon<span class='line-break'> </span>I could see you I would come [over?].<span class='line-break'> </span>I don't know of course what the cost<span class='line-break'> </span>would be, or how much the Society</p>
