<p><a href='/pages/subjects/58078' title='Lovering, James W.'>J.W. Lovering Esq.</a><span class='line-break'> </span>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I was at Mount Auburn on sunday<span class='line-break'> </span>to see the lot which you worked on last fall recovering<span class='line-break'> </span>fence &amp;c (<a href='/pages/subjects/66268' title='Lot 1802'>lot <u>1802</u></a>, <a href='/pages/subjects/59904' title='Spruce Avenue'>Spruce Ave</a>,) and it seems as if the<span class='line-break'> </span>sodding in some parts of the lot needed removing, or<span class='line-break'> </span>grass seed sown where it is thin.  If you will look to<span class='line-break'> </span>it this week I will try and see you on Saturday at<span class='line-break'> </span>the Boston office.  Am in hopes to be able to ratify<span class='line-break'> </span>the contract for perpetual care, which was given us last fall,<span class='line-break'> </span>in a very short time.</p>
<p>Will you please take notice also of the large quantity<span class='line-break'> </span>of moss in the sods, you will remember that only a short<span class='line-break'> </span>time since an amount was paid in addition to the annual<span class='line-break'> </span>care, for wood ashes to kill it out.  It is now worse than<span class='line-break'> </span>ever.</p>
<p>Yours very truly</p>
