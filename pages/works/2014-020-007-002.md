<p>Supt. Cemetery of Mt. Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston. Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Would you kindly inform me<span class='line-break'> </span>in what manner you sell your lots? We are at<span class='line-break'> </span>present and have been selling for 25Â¢ per suare<span class='line-break'> </span>foot and give at that choice of location; but we find<span class='line-break'> </span>we must rate our lots in future; knowing your<span class='line-break'> </span>institution to be one established for a good many years<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; worthy to be followed, I take the liberty to ask for <span class='line-break'> </span>this information. Do you consider it well to hold<span class='line-break'> </span>especially finely located lots or parcels at fixed prices<span class='line-break'> </span>regardless of the number of square feet?</p>
<p>Hoping you will find time to answer<span class='line-break'> </span>and thanking you for your trouble</p>
<p>I am [Sri?]:</p>
<p>Yours respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>Frank Eurich<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt.</p>
