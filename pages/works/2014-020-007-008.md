<p>Jamaica Plain. Mass.<span class='line-break'> </span>July 21/82 Friday</p>
<p>Dear Sir<span class='line-break'></span>This afternoon--after visiting out lot (corner Spruce &amp; <span class='line-break'> </span>Fir Ave's)--I went with some children to the top of the tower,<span class='line-break'> </span>and left my cane hanging to<span class='line-break'> </span>the railing on the top.  It was a dark brown cane with common <span class='line-break'> </span>curving handle; and my name was once plainly cut near the handle, but it may have been worn smooth by this time.<span class='line-break'> </span>I value the cane as an old <span class='line-break'> </span>and very useful companion; and if you have had it left in your<span class='line-break'> </span>charge by the finder, I shall<span class='line-break'> </span>be very glad to get it again.</p>
