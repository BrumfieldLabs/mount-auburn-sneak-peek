<p>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>My sister, Mrs [Latroke?], who visited our<span class='line-break'> </span>Tomb, № 355. in Mt. Auburn, [some marks?] since<span class='line-break'> </span>informs me, that many of the coffins, are in very<span class='line-break'> </span>bad order. [Mould of an oblige?] me, by getting some<span class='line-break'> </span>competent carpenter, to look, at the different coffins<span class='line-break'> </span>and to find me an estimate of the expense<span class='line-break'> </span>of reboxing those, which are much decayed, or <del>all</del><span class='line-break'> </span>of all those, that <del>merit</del> need it .. I would prefer<span class='line-break'> </span>to have the new boxes, made of <ins>red</ins> cedar, which<span class='line-break'> </span>is I believe one of the most durable of woods.</p>
<p>I am [inexperience?] however, on this point. I<span class='line-break'> </span>should prefer to my own opinion. Some years since<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] about ten, I think, I had the coffins of <span class='line-break'> </span>my father + mother reboxed. in strong wooden<span class='line-break'> </span>boxes. I should like to know how those outside <span class='line-break'> </span>boxes. have stood the test. They lie <ins>crosswise</ins><span class='line-break'> </span>at the farthest end of the tomb, on shelves facing<span class='line-break'> </span>you, as you enter the tomb. My address, will be<span class='line-break'> </span>for all next week. New York [?]. New York, <span class='line-break'> </span>after that, [Aidine Gotie?]. Philª at your earliest<span class='line-break'> </span>convenience, please favor me. with a reply I oblige.</p>
<p>Yours [de?]<span class='line-break'> </span><ins>S.W. Dana.</ins></p>
<p>Lovering Esq. Supt.</p>
