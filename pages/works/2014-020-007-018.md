<p>J.W. Lovering</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Allow me to <span class='line-break'> </span>trouble you for some information in regard<span class='line-break'> </span>excavating and building foundations.<span class='line-break'> </span>[After some sharp talking?] I have induced<span class='line-break'> </span>most of the Granite Men to have the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>do this work, but a few insist on putting<span class='line-break'> </span>in their own foundations, and as I<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot afford to stand over them I am<span class='line-break'> </span>satisfied the work is very poorly done<span class='line-break'> </span>and headstones will be leaning right and<span class='line-break'> </span>left, as they now are in Every portion <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Cemetery[.] One party refuses to pay<span class='line-break'> </span>for work ordered because I charged<span class='line-break'> </span>too much, of course we cannot accom<span class='line-break'></span>modate our prices to his notions[.]<span class='line-break'> </span>Can I prohibit him from doing work<span class='line-break'> </span>in the grounds? I should be glad</p>
