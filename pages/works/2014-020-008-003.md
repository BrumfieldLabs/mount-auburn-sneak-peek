<div class="page-content">
<p>[in pencil] Subject: Watering Brattle St. to Elm St.</p>
<p>OFFICE OF<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn Cemetery Corporation,<span class='line-break'> </span>NO. 16 PEMBERTON SQUARE,<span class='line-break'> </span>BOSTON, Mch 22, 1883.</p>
<p>Dear Lovering,</p>
<p>I have talked with<span class='line-break'> </span>Fish &amp; Richards about the watering.<span class='line-break'> </span>R. is very busy, but will call and<span class='line-break'> </span>see you -- He will undoubtedly<span class='line-break'> </span>agree to do the same as last year,<span class='line-break'> </span>and I think will do better, and<span class='line-break'> </span>contribute on Brattle to Elm Ave.</p>
<p>In the meantime he wishes<span class='line-break'> </span>you to see what you can do --<span class='line-break'> </span>O. Donnell &amp; Dee &amp; [Dash? Doyle?] ought to con<span class='line-break'></span>tribute, as will the Gray Estate<span class='line-break'> </span>owners -- I begin to think we<span class='line-break'> </span>may succeed in having Brattle<span class='line-break'> </span>to Elm Av watered -- Perhaps it<span class='line-break'> </span>would be well to ascertain the<span class='line-break'> </span>current terms of the city for Brattle<span class='line-break'> </span>St. unless you know.</p>
<p>Yrs truly</p>
<p>J M Spelman</p>
