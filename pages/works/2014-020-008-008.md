<p>(in pencil on top - Subject: Heirs . . . "too vague" - To Boston Office)</p>
<p>[Letterhead - Office of Mt. Auburn Cemetery Corporation, NO. 16 Pemberton Square, Boston, handwritten April 17, 1883]</p>
<p>J. M. Lovering, Sup't.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:<span class='line-break'> </span>In your <span class='line-break'> </span>estimate of the cost of perpet<span class='line-break'></span>ual care of Lot 4146, you<span class='line-break'> </span>speak of it as owned by<span class='line-break'> </span>[Alvan?] Lawson, but on looking<span class='line-break'> </span>at the records, I find that<span class='line-break'> </span>the deed ran to the "Heirs of<span class='line-break'> </span>[Alvan?] Lawson", so that he<span class='line-break'> </span>never owned the lot himself.</p>
<p>As the contract for repair<span class='line-break'> </span>has to be executed by some<span class='line-break'></span>body, can you tell me who<span class='line-break'> </span>that somebody is to be? if<span class='line-break'> </span>you do not know, perhaps I <span class='line-break'> </span>can find out from A. Ward<span class='line-break'> </span>Lawson.</p>
<p>Resp'y<span class='line-break'> </span>L.G. [?]</p>
