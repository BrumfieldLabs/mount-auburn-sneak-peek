<p>Dorchester, Mass August 25, 83<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr. J.W. Lovering.<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge Mass</p>
<p>Dear Sir.<span class='line-break'> </span>I am proprietor of a lot and <span class='line-break'> </span>monument in the cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>in Concord Mass. The monument<span class='line-break'> </span>is of the best (?) marble, and<span class='line-break'> </span>was made in 1857. There are oak<span class='line-break'> </span>trees in the cemetery but none in<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot, which is somewhat shaded by<span class='line-break'> </span>the foliage in otehr lots.</p>
<p>The monument has become stained<span class='line-break'> </span>and discolored.</p>
<p>Nothing has been done to remove<span class='line-break'> </span>the stains.</p>
<p>I now wish to cleanse the marble,<span class='line-break'> </span>and seek to find the best means and<span class='line-break'> </span>method</p>
<p>I consulted the secretary in Boston</p>
