<p>To. Supt. Mount Auburn Cemetery.<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Sir; -- Herewith please find Memorial rela<span class='line-break'></span>ting to the purification of Water by Air Treatment.</p>
<p>This method of destroying foul, unwholesome organ<span class='line-break'></span>ic substances in large bodies of water is the only effect<span class='line-break'></span>ual means known at the present time, and is endorsed<span class='line-break'> </span>by the most eminent Scientists in the Country.</p>
<p>Prof. Silliman's <sup>letter</sup> of Yale College, is enclosed in the<span class='line-break'> </span>Memorial. It is well known that impure<span class='line-break'> </span>water in Ponds is one of the predisposing causes of<span class='line-break'> </span>malarial fever and kindred diseases prevailing in their<span class='line-break'> </span>vicinity, and the large and constant correspondence<span class='line-break'> </span>now received in these matters shows the interest<span class='line-break'> </span>that the public are taking for sanitary protection.</p>
<p>I should be pleased to correspond with you<span class='line-break'> </span>on this subject, and can assure you that the Ponds<span class='line-break'> </span>in Mount Auburn Cemetery can be purified at comparative<span class='line-break'></span>ly little expense, and kept so by very little labor. Please</p>
