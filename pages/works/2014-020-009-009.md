<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>My wife who<span class='line-break'> </span>recently died was buried<span class='line-break'> </span>in the lot of my father<span class='line-break'> </span>Judge Loring -- the num<span class='line-break'></span>ber of the lot being <u>1223</u>.</p>
<p>It was my desire as<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot had never been <span class='line-break'> </span>used and consequently<span class='line-break'> </span>uncared for, to have it <span class='line-break'> </span>put in better order.</p>

<p>It was my wish and<span class='line-break'> </span>that of my wife's sister<span class='line-break'> </span>to begin the improve<span class='line-break'></span>ments by having a plain<span class='line-break'> </span>simple wrought iron<span class='line-break'> </span>railing placed round<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot. On making <span class='line-break'> </span>some enquiries at the<span class='line-break'> </span>manufacturers I was<span class='line-break'> </span>informed that iron fences<span class='line-break'> </span>were no longer allowed<span class='line-break'> </span>to be put up in Mount<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn and my object<span class='line-break'> </span>in writing to you is to<span class='line-break'> </span>ascertain in an official<span class='line-break'> </span>way what the true<span class='line-break'> </span>nature of the restriction<span class='line-break'> </span>is or if any exists.</p>
<p>Would you therefore<span class='line-break'> </span>kindly inform me<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to this and<span class='line-break'> </span>oblige.</p>
