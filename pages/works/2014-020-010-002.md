<p>MEMORANDUM</p>
<p>F. GELDOWSKY,<span class='line-break'> </span>FURNITURE<span class='line-break'> </span>EAST CAMBRIDGE, MASS., Oct. 7<sup>th</sup> 1886.</p>
<p>TO Mr. J.W. Lovering<span class='line-break'> </span>Supt. Mt. Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>[in pencil] 2690</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your favor of the 6<sup>th</sup>received with<span class='line-break'> </span>bills, as requested, for which please accept my thanks.</p>
<p>I am very glad to learn that one of the trees<span class='line-break'> </span>is to be removed; hope it may be the one on the side<span class='line-break'> </span>where the new tablets have been placed.</p>
<p>I do not wish to seem too persistent in this matter,<span class='line-break'> </span>but would ask if it is not possible to remove the <u>two</u>.<span class='line-break'> </span>As you visited the lot, you could not fail to see the<span class='line-break'> </span>condition of the grass in front, caused by the dense<span class='line-break'> </span>shade. I shall be obliged to newly sod the entire front<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>this fall or next spring, but do not<span class='line-break'> </span>care to go to the Expense if the <span class='line-break'> </span>cause of the decay cannot be<span class='line-break'> </span>removed. It was only three years<span class='line-break'> </span>ago that I went through the same<span class='line-break'> </span>work, and now it is worse off<span class='line-break'> </span>than before, because of growth of trees.<span class='line-break'> </span>May I also ask if there is any<span class='line-break'> </span>way by which the lot may be<span class='line-break'> </span>rid of the <u>squirrels</u> which infest<span class='line-break'> </span>it, having burrowed into it in<span class='line-break'> </span>numerous places? I presume the<span class='line-break'> </span>removal of the trees would in a<span class='line-break'> </span>measure obviate this difficulty, as<span class='line-break'> </span>they would probably seek more<span class='line-break'> </span>shady quarters.</p>
<p>Please pardon me for annoying<span class='line-break'> </span>you so much, but it is difficult for<span class='line-break'> </span>me to call and see you during your<span class='line-break'> </span>office hours, hence am obliged to<span class='line-break'> </span>write. I called last eve. but was<span class='line-break'> </span>Awaiting your reply. I am,</p>
<p>Yours very truly</p>
