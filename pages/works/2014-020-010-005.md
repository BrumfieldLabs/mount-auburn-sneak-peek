<p>J.W. Lovering Esqr.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>We have an appropriation of<span class='line-break'> </span>$25000 [$250.00? $2500.00?] to erect a gateway at the<span class='line-break'> </span>main entrance to our Cemetery</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty to write<span class='line-break'> </span>to you, sending some Photographic<span class='line-break'> </span>views, of the entrance as it now<span class='line-break'> </span>is, with a ground plan showing<span class='line-break'> </span>the approach both ways, also<span class='line-break'> </span>the distance of the chapel<span class='line-break'> </span>from the road, with a plan<span class='line-break'> </span>of the change I think of making</p>
<p>The Chapel is built of Westerly<span class='line-break'> </span>Gray granite. Any advice <span class='line-break'> </span>you could offer, I shall [desire?]<span class='line-break'> </span>it a favor to receive, as to<span class='line-break'> </span>which would look best and<span class='line-break'> </span>be most durable, an Arch or<span class='line-break'> </span>an open gateway there being</p>
