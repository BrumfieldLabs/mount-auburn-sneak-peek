<p>At the time of the<span class='line-break'> </span>uncovering of the flower-beds and the myrtles, in <span class='line-break'> </span>April, and after the greater part ^of the brush covering^ had been re<span class='line-break'></span>moved and placed in piles, the writer in his<span class='line-break'> </span>official capacity as chairman of the John A.

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In reply to your favor of May 10 -- I desire to<span class='line-break'> </span>say that the ^general directions to the^ workmen <span class='line-break'> </span>are to remove no flags, flowers or other memorials<span class='line-break'> </span>until they are broken or faded<span class='line-break'> </span>so as to be unsightly, and that ^late^ in the fall [&amp;? indecipherable] I have frequently<span class='line-break'> </span>seen the flags torn &amp; broken, tho' I am inclined to<span class='line-break'> </span>think that those placed last year were stronger than [the?]<span class='line-break'> </span>[indecipherable].</p>
<p>A ^few weeks^ before Decoration Day it has<span class='line-break'> </span>always been customary to remove the old<span class='line-break'> </span>decorations to make room for the new, and <span class='line-break'> </span>no objection has every been made.</p>
