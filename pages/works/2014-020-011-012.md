<p>Mr. J.W. Lovering, <span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent Mt. Auburn Cemetery, <span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge, Mass.,</p>
<p>Dear Sir : -</p>
<p>We send you by Hatches Express to-day 30 Lawn <span class='line-break'> </span>Mower Wheels to replace those returned to us defective. We trust <span class='line-break'> </span>you will pardon the delay in getting these wheels, but upon stating <span class='line-break'> </span>the case to the manufacturers, they said they would have a new lot <span class='line-break'> </span>cast extra heavy, which they have done, and with which we think you <span class='line-break'> </span>will have no trouble. We have received from you 17 Wheels ;- kindly <span class='line-break'> </span>return the remaining 18 so that we may send the full number on to <span class='line-break'> </span>the manufacturers</p>
<p>Yours very truly. <span class='line-break'> </span>Joseph Breck &amp; Sons,<span class='line-break'> </span>G</p>
