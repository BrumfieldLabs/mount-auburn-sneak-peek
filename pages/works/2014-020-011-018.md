<p>Subject: Justifiable complaint about ivy</p>
<p>Hotel Humboldt - Roxbury - Mass,<span class='line-break'> </span>Nov. 26 - '88.</p>
<p>Mr. J. W. Lovering Sup<sup>t</sup>.</p>
<p>I rec<sup>d</sup> a communication <span class='line-break'> </span>from you a few days since<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to "the Ivy", placed<span class='line-break'> </span>on Lot 3225, the past summer.</p>
<p>Was very much surprised,<span class='line-break'> </span>when you quote the gardener,<span class='line-break'> </span>as having stated that, the<span class='line-break'> </span>plant is not at all hardy &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>cannot be made to live<span class='line-break'> </span>out of doors.</p>

<p>when the very severe weather<span class='line-break'> </span>came on, taken from the fence<span class='line-break'> </span>and leaves thrown over, and<span class='line-break'> </span>this plant from which the slip<span class='line-break'> </span>was taken grew on a wall +<span class='line-break'> </span>never protected in the winter.</p>
<p>I now feel that if the<span class='line-break'> </span>plant had been properly set<span class='line-break'> </span>out and cared for through<span class='line-break'> </span>the summer, it would now <span class='line-break'> </span>have been in better condition.</p>
<p>The loss of this same<span class='line-break'> </span>I most deeply regret, as<span class='line-break'> </span>associations, connected<span class='line-break'> </span>with it no monied value<span class='line-break'> </span>can replace</p>
<p>So it now is, I think the<span class='line-break'> </span>least that can be done, if it<span class='line-break'> </span>is dead in the spring, to allow<span class='line-break'> </span>the sod to be replaced.</p>
<p>Respectfully J.E. Neale</p>
