<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A Hearse was driven out from<span class='line-break'> </span>the Cemetery main gate yesterday (Sunday)<span class='line-break'> </span>about 3-45<sub>P.M.</sub>, too rapidly to make it Entirely<span class='line-break'> </span>safe for carriages approaching Cambridge<span class='line-break'> </span>from the direction of Watertown, then in<span class='line-break'> </span>that vicinity -- in fact, I was fortunate<span class='line-break'> </span>enough, by prompt action, to avoid a<span class='line-break'> </span>collision -- Let me suggest the enforcement<span class='line-break'> </span>of a rule that all vehicles shall leave the<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery in a walk, and hope it may<span class='line-break'> </span>meet your approval.</p>
<p>Very truly Yours</p>
<p>Henry H. Gilmore.<span class='line-break'> </span>Mayor.</p>
