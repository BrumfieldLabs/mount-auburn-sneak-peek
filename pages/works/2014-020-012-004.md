<p>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Your letter with complaint<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to Hearse being rapidly driven out<span class='line-break'> </span>of Cemetery just rec'd.</p>
<p>Our driver claims there was only one team<span class='line-break'> </span>passing when he came out of gate, and that it<span class='line-break'> </span>was in the rail and track and that there was ample<span class='line-break'> </span>room between the two teams (which were both going<span class='line-break'> </span>towards the City) for another team to pass between<span class='line-break'> </span>the [team?]. He says neither team stopped,<span class='line-break'> </span>nor did the driver say any thing to him, and he<span class='line-break'> </span>thinks there must be some mistake. If it were<span class='line-break'> </span>one of the Hacks it would not be strange, as they<span class='line-break'> </span>[are?] mostly strange drivers to us and like a great<span class='line-break'> </span>many Hack Drivers perfectly irresponsible. --</p>

<p>This is the first complaint we ever<span class='line-break'> </span>had against our drivers. Of course if he is to<span class='line-break'> </span>blame it is quite as much for our interest to<span class='line-break'> </span>know it as for any one else, but we do not wish<span class='line-break'> </span>to blame him for what he has not done, and<span class='line-break'> </span>he insists most strenuously that there is an<span class='line-break'> </span>error some where.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your polite note</p>
<p>We remain</p>
<p>Yours Very Truly</p>
