<p>Collector's Department,<span class='line-break'> </span>City Hall,<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, July 10<sup><u>th</u></sup> 1887</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Lovering,</p>
<p>I always thought<span class='line-break'> </span>that perpetual care simply meant the<span class='line-break'> </span>cutting of the grass, the setting out of<span class='line-break'> </span>flowers and the renewing of the myrtle,<span class='line-break'> </span>when necessary. That is [no?] [way? very?] enough was<span class='line-break'> </span>paid in to cover the cost of these each<span class='line-break'> </span>year, [with all?] of the annual bills.<span class='line-break'> </span>I never contemplated any resetting of stones,<span class='line-break'> </span>or erection of monuments.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>F.R. [Fire..?]</p>
<p>Donation<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
