<p>Mr. THOMAS DOLIBER<span class='line-break'> </span>41 CENTRAL WHARF<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston Nov. 22, 1889.</p>
<p>Supt. Mt. Auburn Cemetery,<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:--</p>
<p>I have been informed by the Treasurer that I can place<span class='line-break'> </span>my cemetery lot No. 4199 under the perpetual care of the corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>and that the corporation will assume it on my paying <sup>$</sup>475.00..</p>
<p>As you now take care of the lot for <sup>$</sup>8.00 per year, this seems<span class='line-break'> </span>to me a very large sum; perhaps you will be able to tell me how the<span class='line-break'> </span>calculation is made, and whether it cannot be done for a less sum.<span class='line-break'> </span><u>$</u>300.00 at 3% would yield <u>$</u>9.00 per year, and I thought perhaps the<span class='line-break'> </span>corporation would be ready to undertake it for somewhere in the<span class='line-break'> </span>neighborhood of that sum.</p>
<p>Will you kindly reply, and much oblige,</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>Thomas Doliber</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>You can pay the Corporation three hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars in trust &amp; the income will be spent on the<span class='line-break'> </span>care of the lot, as far as it proves sufficient,<span class='line-break'> </span>whether it does or not, depending on the<span class='line-break'> </span>rate of interest and the cost of labor.</p>
<p>In making <s>this</s> the cost of perpetual<span class='line-break'> </span>care with guaranty,<sup>four hundred &amp; seventy five dollars,</sup> the washing of the head<span class='line-break'></span>stones and the repairing of the sod is included<span class='line-break'> </span>for both of which you would pay in addition<span class='line-break'> </span>to the amount now paid annually, and as the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation agrees in <s>the</s> a contract <s>repair</s><sup>will guaranty to keep the</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>lot in good order, there must of course be a margin<span class='line-break'> </span>to cover fluctuation in cost of labor, or rate of<span class='line-break'> </span>interest; in other words, in the latter form of<span class='line-break'> </span>contract the Corporation takes the risk of the<span class='line-break'> </span>cost of labor and rate of interest, while in the<span class='line-break'> </span>former the <s>prop.</s> lot owner does, the liability of<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation ceasing when the income has been<span class='line-break'> </span>properly extended.</p>
