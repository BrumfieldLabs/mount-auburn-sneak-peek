<p>(in pencil on top) Subject: Trees<span class='line-break'> </span>Letterhead: Office of Mt. Auburn Cemetery Corporation, No. 5 Tremont Street, H.B. Mackintosh, Treasurer, L.G. Farmer, Secretary</p>
<p>Boston, Dec. 2, 1889</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Lovering,<span class='line-break'> </span>I concluded to settle the Gilbert tree matter by [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] after all. I note much, as I <span class='line-break'> </span>proposed, insisting however, as to [?],<span class='line-break'> </span>"that he had not been neglectful, <span class='line-break'> </span>and regardless of your wishes."<span class='line-break'> </span>I added at the close "Possibly at<span class='line-break'> </span>some future time by growth of other<span class='line-break'> </span>trees it may be practicable to have<span class='line-break'> </span>this one cut down" - now to back<span class='line-break'> </span>this up. I propose you set out <span class='line-break'> </span>in that locality several new trees<span class='line-break'> </span>(crossed out - "in that neighborhood"), and if<span class='line-break'> </span>anything is said to you on this<span class='line-break'> </span>subject, you can say you intend<span class='line-break'> </span>to do it, as soon as the state of the<span class='line-break'> </span>ground permits.</p>
<p>[??]<span class='line-break'> </span>J.M. [?]</p>
