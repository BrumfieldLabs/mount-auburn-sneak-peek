<p>Boston, October 16th, 1889.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Lovering</p>
<p>I submit application of Ch. A. Vialle to employ Wright + [?] to set steps, buttreses, + posts in Lot #2481, for your consideration, before issuing a permit to do the work.<span class='line-break'> </span>From recent consultations with you, it is well understood as the office that no permit shall be given until a plan is submitted to Supt; but, in regard to laying the foundation for stone work which is placed on the ground of the Corporation, and for placing the stone work on the foundation, is a question about which we should like more definite instruction.<span class='line-break'> </span>Shall we permit outside parties to plan foundations + lay stone work, which is to rest on the land of the Corporation? A written reply to this is desired.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<span class='line-break'> </span>H.B. MacKintosh<span class='line-break'> </span>Treas<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
