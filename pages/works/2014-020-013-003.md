<p>Watertown Feb'y 6th/90</p>
<p>To Mr. James M. Lovering,<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendent of Mt. Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery</p>
<p>Dear Sir<span class='line-break'> </span>I received your proposal for the <span class='line-break'> </span>care of lot (perpetual) 4096 Ash<span class='line-break'> </span>Ave for $575, in Dec last; I received<span class='line-break'> </span>the proposal in 1872 for $350.<span class='line-break'> </span>At that time did not have the<span class='line-break'> </span>money to spare, having large<span class='line-break'> </span>expenses and small income; It<span class='line-break'> </span>occurred to me that there is to much<span class='line-break'> </span>difference in the amounts. I am<span class='line-break'> </span>ready to have it cared for at this <span class='line-break'> </span>time at a fair price. I find<span class='line-break'> </span>the Lot is in good order at the<span class='line-break'> </span>present time, and cannot conceive<span class='line-break'> </span>why there should be so much difference in price.</p>
<p>Yours Most Respectfully,<span class='line-break'> </span>William Edwards.</p>
<p>(ON LEFT SIDE OF PAGE) - <span class='line-break'> </span>Dear Sir<span class='line-break'> </span>I think that the difference<span class='line-break'> </span>in cost of the perpetual care of<span class='line-break'> </span>your lot is largely due to the dif<span class='line-break'> </span>ference rate of interest in<span class='line-break'> </span>which the cost is based.</p>
<p>(Crossed out "At the time") In 1872 the<span class='line-break'> </span>price changes were based on<span class='line-break'> </span>an income of 6% which could<span class='line-break'> </span>be obtained as readily as 4%<span class='line-break'> </span>can now.</p>
<p>(Crossed out "You (Sp?) the price named (sp?) is based on")<span class='line-break'> </span>The amount can be reduced<span class='line-break'> </span>$100 by omitting the plants.</p>
