<p>To Supt.<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt. Auburn Cemetery [Assn.?]</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Would say that<span class='line-break'> </span>this Gray Horse sent here for examination <span class='line-break'> </span>is lame in the hock joint. -- The trouble<span class='line-break'> </span>is spavin. The treatment that I should<span class='line-break'> </span>advise would be filling &amp; blistering, which<span class='line-break'> </span>would necessitate laying him off work<span class='line-break'> </span>for about 10 weeks. Not knowing if<span class='line-break'> </span>you would care to lay him off that<span class='line-break'> </span>length of time, I send with him some<span class='line-break'> </span>liniment to be rubbed into the part, and<span class='line-break'> </span>would advise resting him for about a week<span class='line-break'> </span>and then putting him in light work. If this<span class='line-break'> </span>does not improve him then he should<span class='line-break'> </span>be [fired &amp; blistered?]. The Chestnut mare is<span class='line-break'> </span>showing no bad behavior just now her<span class='line-break'> </span>trouble I think due to some<sup>irritation of her</sup> sexual organs<span class='line-break'> </span>which I think may pass off entirely. I send</p>

<p>for her a package of powder which<span class='line-break'> </span>I think will help her. If she does<span class='line-break'> </span>not improve should like to hear from<span class='line-break'> </span>you as perhaps I could suggest<span class='line-break'> </span>something else that would help her</p>
