<p>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>Our Catalogue and I presume<span class='line-break'> </span>many others have a price stated of $5.00 for opening<span class='line-break'> </span>and interment of adults in plain grave. Our<span class='line-break'> </span>ground not being prepared more than a foot deep<span class='line-break'> </span>in the older portion we [meet?] [many?] rocks, and stones<span class='line-break'> </span>[caving in of the sides?] &amp;c. so that I could not<span class='line-break'> </span>see any money in this work at $5.-- and have<span class='line-break'> </span>increased the price to $8.-- This includes<span class='line-break'> </span>covering the Earth with [grei..?] when we have the<span class='line-break'> </span>material and time [and?] [seemed?] somewhat by the<span class='line-break'> </span>standing &amp; wealth of the family, also the watering<span class='line-break'> </span>of grass if opened in daytime, the filling up of<span class='line-break'> </span>the grave and sodding when the [boy?] [charge?]<span class='line-break'> </span>at some later day, shovelling sufficient walks<span class='line-break'> </span>in Snow time and covering the lot with wooden<span class='line-break'> </span>walks in wet or snowy Weather. In all this<span class='line-break'> </span>there is certainly no money at $5.-- But since<span class='line-break'> </span>Undertaker [or?] [somebody?] has complained to the<span class='line-break'> </span>Directors, and they may have an idea that the<span class='line-break'> </span>price is Exorbitant or more than other places charge</p>
