<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>On the behalf of our Corp<span class='line-break'> </span>I am directed to solicit your kindness in answering the following<span class='line-break'> </span>queries should you feel at liberty to oblige us.</p>
<p>Viz.</p>

<p><table class='tabular'><thead><span class='line-break'> </span><tr><th>7</th> <th>From a business stand point what is your Rule<span class='line-break'> </span></th></tr></thead> </table> occasioned by the inability of the interested party or next of kin<span class='line-break'> </span>to purchase a single grave? And how are your Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>Authorities assured of the fact?</p>
<p>The Authorities of the Church of England here claim that our Corp.<span class='line-break'> </span>(a Joint-Stock Corp. not under Ecclesiastical control) should be able to<span class='line-break'> </span>produce any remains buried in our Cemetery. According to our<span class='line-break'> </span>practice in the case of Pauper Interments to do so would not always<span class='line-break'> </span>be possible.</p>
<p>We would esteem it a favor if you could spare us a<span class='line-break'> </span>copy of your last Annual Report. Also a copy of your By-Laws<span class='line-break'> </span>and Cemetery Rules if you have them for distribution, as<span class='line-break'> </span>we would like still further to profit by information about<span class='line-break'> </span>your magnificent Cemetery.</p>
<p>Last July during a hurried trip to Boston I was<span class='line-break'> </span>privilleged in spending between two and three hours in Mt. Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery but had to leave without seeing either yourself or<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Lovering, my time being very short.</p>
<p>I was greatly impressed with the grandeur of Mt.<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn and mean some day to see it again.</p>
<p>Hoping you will kindly reply I beg to remain</p>
<p>Respectfully yours</p>
