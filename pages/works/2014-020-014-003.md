<p>from John.C. Gordon.</p>
<p>Beechwood Cemetery Company.</p>
<p>Canada</p>
<p>Ottawa,  Feby 16th 1891</p>
<p>James.W. Lovering Esq<span class='line-break'> </span>Cambridge Mass, U.S.A</p>
<p>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Your obliging and prompt<span class='line-break'> </span>reply of the 31st January received in due course.<span class='line-break'> </span>On behalf of our Company and myself I thank yourself and<span class='line-break'> </span>Mr [Harmen?] very much.</p>
<p>We are greatly pleased<span class='line-break'> </span>with the very favorable report of the affairs of your<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery which you kindly mailed us.              I am<span class='line-break'> </span>glad of the Plan of grounds which it contains.  I am<span class='line-break'> </span>enabled there by to recall and trace out some of my<span class='line-break'> </span>wanderings in Mt Auburn during my visit of last July.<span class='line-break'> </span>Another item of advantage to us which it contains is the<span class='line-break'> </span>prices of caring for lots.  We annually take care of aboutt<span class='line-break'> </span>five hundred Lots ourselves in this way and your rates will<span class='line-break'> </span>assist us in establishing a uniform tariff-</p>
<p>I do not notice a form for "Certificate of Burial"<span class='line-break'> </span>As you state you do not bury any Paupers we<span class='line-break'> </span>conclude there is a special Cemetery for them as<span class='line-break'> </span>our recollection of Boston + Cambridge was that while<span class='line-break'> </span>there was abundant evidence of "refinement"- and wealth<span class='line-break'> </span>[as?] because the Hub<span class='line-break'> </span>there was also conclusive indications of much poverty<span class='line-break'> </span>and of course the considerable cost of $30.00 for<span class='line-break'> </span>interment would preclude their burial in your cemetery.</p>
<p>Thanking you sincerely I remain</p>
<p>Faithfully yours</p>
<p>John. C. Gordon          Supt-  Beechd Cemetery</p>
