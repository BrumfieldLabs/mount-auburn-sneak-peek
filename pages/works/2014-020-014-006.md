<p>AGENCY OF THE<span class='line-break'> </span>GERMAN AMERICAN INSURANCE CO.<span class='line-break'> </span>of New York.</p>
<p>JAS BRUERTON, Manager,<span class='line-break'> </span>Branch Office, 24 Exchange Place,</p>

<p>J.W. Loring, Esq., Superintendent<span class='line-break'> </span>of Mt. Auburn Cemetery,</p>
<p>Dear Sir: --</p>
<p>I am in receipt of your favor of<span class='line-break'> </span>the 3rd. inst., suggesting the removal of the tree <span class='line-break'> </span>from our lot #2902. This tree has grown from a<span class='line-break'> </span>slip planted there by my mother, and I should re<span class='line-break'></span>gret exceedingly, having it removed, although if<span class='line-break'> </span>it is actually liable to injure the property of<span class='line-break'> </span>others, I should feel the necessity of giving my<span class='line-break'> </span>consent.  I will endeavor to get out there soon<span class='line-break'> </span>and will confer with you, about it.</p>
<p>Yours Resp'y.,</p>
<p>James Bruerton</p>
