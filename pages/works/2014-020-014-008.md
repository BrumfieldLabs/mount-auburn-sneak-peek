<p>My dear Mr. Levering,</p>
<p>I was at Mt Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>on Thursday + noticed that<span class='line-break'> </span>my lot looked badly + in fact,<span class='line-break'> </span>the worst looking lot in the<span class='line-break'> </span>vicinity + It was very uneven<span class='line-break'> </span>+ needs a [rolling?] . + the sod<span class='line-break'> </span>needs [replacing?] in several<span class='line-break'> </span>places. If the lot was in<span class='line-break'> </span>my care I should have<span class='line-break'> </span>it resodded. As it was<span class='line-break'> </span>part of the estimate that<span class='line-break'> </span>it would require <ins>resodding</ins><span class='line-break'> </span><ins>every 6 or 7 years</ins> I would<span class='line-break'> </span>suggest that you do it soon<span class='line-break'> </span>+ with good care I think<span class='line-break'> </span>it will last more than<span class='line-break'> </span>7 Years - Yours truly Mrs. [AR M?]</p>
