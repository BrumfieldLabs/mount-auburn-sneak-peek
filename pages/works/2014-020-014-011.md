<p>My dear Sir:-</p>
<p>I take the liberty of asking a personal favor of you.<span class='line-break'> </span>J.J. DeLaney &amp; Co. have recently put an inscription as to my mother's<span class='line-break'> </span>birth and death upon the monument in the lot at Mt. Auburn.  As it is <span class='line-break'> </span>very incovenient for me at this season of the year to look at the<span class='line-break'> </span>work,would it be trespassing too much upon your kindness to ask you <span class='line-break'> </span>to examine the work and see if it is properly done and report to me<span class='line-break'> </span>that I may pay their bill?</p>
<p>Very truly yours,<span class='line-break'> </span>Chas. Merriam</p>
