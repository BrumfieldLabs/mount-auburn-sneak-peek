<p>Boston, Jan. 22^d^ 1892</p>
<p>To the<span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation of Mt. Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>A recent interment in lot 1249<span class='line-break'> </span>Alianthus Path -- standing in the name of George<span class='line-break'> </span>P. Tewksbury -- brought to notice that on September<span class='line-break'> </span>6^th^ 1847 an interment of one "Nancy P.<span class='line-break'> </span>Spear aged 18 years" is entered on<span class='line-break'> </span>your books as having been made in<span class='line-break'> </span>this lot. We made a visit to your office<span class='line-break'> </span>at Mt. Auburn the day following the recent<span class='line-break'> </span>interment and [I? can?] the [indecipherable] -- This Nancy P.<span class='line-break'> </span>Spear is not known to the family -- and caused<span class='line-break'> </span>some disappointment in placing the body of<span class='line-break'> </span>an aged sister last October. There are but<span class='line-break'> </span>five interments of the family -- Lydia -- Ellen -<span class='line-break'></span>George -- Harriet T. -- H. Elizabeth -- the sixth Nancy<span class='line-break'> </span>P. Spear cannot be accounted for and there<span class='line-break'> </span>must be some mistake which ought for<span class='line-break'> </span>obvious reasons to be explained.</p>
<p>Will you kindly give it your attention and advise</p>
<p>Yours Very Respectfully</p>
<p>Chas. O. Eaton</p>
<p>42 and 44 Camb St</p>
