<div class="page-content">
<p>Subject. Myrtle Graves<span class='line-break'> </span>" P.C. without Renewal</p>
<p>Lot 1174</p>
<p>Boston. 182 Marlborough St. <span class='line-break'> </span>Feb 8. 1892</p>
<p>J.W. Lovering. Superintendent.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Referring to the communication from Mr. Mackintosh<span class='line-break'> </span>in regard to placing Lot 1174 under the perpetual care of the Corpora<span class='line-break'></span>tion, and to the proposition to deduct $900.00 from the required sum if the myrtle be removed from the graves, I would inquire whether the <span class='line-break'> </span>myrtle may not be allowed to remain, and be even covered up in winter, <span class='line-break'> </span>without expense; we agreeing that, <u>if the plant dies, it need not be re-</u><span class='line-break'> </span><u>placed. </u></p>
<p>It seems rather hard, after having gone to considerable ex<span class='line-break'></span>pense to plant myrtle on these graves, to now wilfully destroy it.</p>
<p>Yours truly <span class='line-break'> </span>H Derby.</p>
