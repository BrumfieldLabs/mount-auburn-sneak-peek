<p>$500.00 cannot be accepted unless the mrytle is removed first.</p>
<p>In case other headstones should be placed upon the lot, the</p>
<p>necessary amount can be added from time to time. The sums named</p>
<p>to you provide only for care of those stones now on the lot.</p>
<p>Respecfully yours,</p>
