<p>The closing paragraphs of a<span class='line-break'> </span>sermon preached at <a href='/pages/subjects/72025' title='Belmont, MA'>Belmont</a>, <date when='1858-12-05'>December 5<sup>th</sup>,<span class='line-break'> </span>1858</date>, -- being the Sunday after the funeral <span class='line-break'> </span>of <a href='/pages/subjects/90711' title='Mead, Maria M.'>Mrs Maria M. Mead</a>.</p>
<p>The afflictive event which<span class='line-break'> </span>has suggested to us our theme to-day,<span class='line-break'> </span>I need not name, for it is full in the<span class='line-break'> </span>knowledge, and will long be vivid in the<span class='line-break'> </span>recollection, of us all. It cannot have<span class='line-break'> </span>taken any of us by surprise, for we<span class='line-break'> </span>have long known that our friend's illness<span class='line-break'> </span>was beyond the restoring power alike of<span class='line-break'> </span>affectionate ministrations and of experi<span class='line-break'></span>enced skill. And now death has gently<span class='line-break'> </span>interposed, and released her patient spirit</p>
