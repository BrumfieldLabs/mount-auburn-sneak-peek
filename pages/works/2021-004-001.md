<p>The committee to whom was referred <span class='line-break'> </span>the vote of the Proprietors of the Cemetery of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn at their last annual meeting <span class='line-break'> </span>on the subject of the care of Lots</p>
<p>Report, -</p>
<p>That the Trustees feel bound<span class='line-break'> </span>to receive with respectful attention all <span class='line-break'> </span>suggestions coming from the Proprietors;  but <span class='line-break'> </span>that it is impossible for them to keep in <span class='line-break'> </span>proper order an aggregate of nearly 3000<span class='line-break'> </span>private lots, which number is constantly increasing,<span class='line-break'> </span>-and at the same time to pay the necessary <span class='line-break'> </span>expenses of the Cemetery, without consuming more <span class='line-break'> </span>than their whole income, and frustrating the purposes<span class='line-break'> </span>of the permanent fund, which they have covenanted with <span class='line-break'> </span>their new proprietors, to increase and keep inviolate.</p>
<p>Besides which <sup>the Committee have doubts whether</sup> The Trusees<sup>would </sup> have any right to enter<span class='line-break'> </span>and repair, or otherwise alter, the lots of Proprietors,<span class='line-break'> </span>without the consent and specific instructions of each <span class='line-break'> </span>proprietor to that effect -<span class='line-break'> </span>Charles P.
