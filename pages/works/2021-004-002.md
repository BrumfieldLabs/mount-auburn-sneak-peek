<p>The Committee to whom in April <span class='line-break'> </span>last was referred the duty, to mature &amp; report <span class='line-break'> </span>a plan for establishing an accumulating Fund <span class='line-break'> </span>for the perpetual repair &amp; preservation of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery - have considereed the said subject, <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; a majority of them ask leave to report -<span class='line-break'> </span>that in their opinion it is meet &amp; proper that <span class='line-break'> </span>such a Fund should be created<sup>&amp; for[?] hold forth as a [?]</sup>. - up to <span class='line-break'> </span>present time, the expenses of the Cemetery, <span class='line-break'> </span>of all kinds, have been defrayed by the proceeds <span class='line-break'> </span>of the sales of Lots;  This  source of revenue <span class='line-break'> </span>must sooner or later cease to exist, and <span class='line-break'> </span>inasmuch as there is no authority in the <span class='line-break'> </span>charter for imposing assessments on the <span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietors, the time must inevitably arrive, <span class='line-break'> </span>when, if some such measure as the Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>propose, be not adopted, the Company will be <span class='line-break'> </span>without the means of discharging their ordinary <span class='line-break'> </span>expenses. - Your Comm<sup>ee</sup> cannot believe <span class='line-break'> </span>that this would be a wise policy.  It would <span class='line-break'> </span>partake too much of the character of the youth <span class='line-break'> </span>who uses up his capital without making pro<span class='line-break'></span>vision for his old age. - Your Com<sup>dd</sup> have <span class='line-break'> </span>obtained from the Treasurer a statement of the <span class='line-break'> </span>product of sales of land from 1847 to 1855<span class='line-break'> </span>inclusive - say nine years - amounting<span class='line-break'> </span><span class='depth3' depth='3' title='$157301'>$157301</span><span class='line-break'> </span>to one hundred &amp; fifty seven thousand three</p>

On the same <span class='line-break'> </span>principles the average for the last four years <span class='line-break'> </span>is nine thousand three hundred &amp; seventy five <span class='line-break'> </span>dollars a year.  Each Trustee can form as <span class='line-break'> </span>good a judgment of the future prospects of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Company in regard to the produce of sales, <span class='line-break'> </span>as the Committee can;  but the Comm<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>suppose that for some years to come, the sales will <span class='line-break'> </span>not be less than they have been during the year <span class='line-break'> </span>1856<sup>but will be more.</sup>  If this estimate be well founded &amp; the <span class='line-break'> </span>ordinary expenses do not exceed <del>seven<sup>ten</sup></del> thousand <span class='line-break'> </span>dollars a year, there will be in the Treasury <span class='line-break'> </span>a balance of ten <sup>or eleven</sup> thousand dollars, to be applied<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>The<sup>present</sup>debts including the mortgage for the <span class='line-break'> </span>Stone Farm, do not exceed twenty Two thousand dollars<span class='line-break'> </span>and there are now in the hands of the Treasurer, <span class='line-break'> </span>Bank &amp; other shares, the market value of which <span class='line-break'> </span>is nineteen thousand dollars.</p>
<p>It will be born in mind that your Com<sup>ee</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>have taken no notice of the income received by <span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation fron Stocks or other sources, for defray<span class='line-break'></span>ing current expenses;  they are desirous of confirm<span class='line-break'></span>ing their views entirely to the probable product <span class='line-break'> </span>from the sales of land as a means of establishing <span class='line-break'> </span>an accumulating Fund.</p>
<p>Your Com<sup>ee</sup> from these premises have <span class='line-break'> </span>come to the conclusion that the Trustees may <span class='line-break'> </span>with safety set aside every year<sup>not less than one fifth part of the gross<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] of the sales of lots</sup><del>? as five thousand dollars</del>for the purpose aforesaid. -<span class='line-break'> </span>and as there is no Institution <u>apparently</u>so well <span class='line-break'> </span>protected from the vicissitudes of trade, as the <span class='line-break'> </span>Massachusestts Hospital Life Insurance Company, \<span class='line-break'> </span>-  The Committee recommend that out of the pro<span class='line-break'></span>ceeds of sales of lots in 1857 the<sup>above appropriation thereof  </sup> <del>sum of Five<span class='line-break'> </span>thousand dollars </del> be deposited by the Treasurer<span class='line-break'> </span>with <del>that</del><sup>the fact</sup> Company<sup>provided that the Trustees for the time<span class='line-break'> </span>being shall deem the same to be [?]</sup> upon the principle of ac<span class='line-break'></span>cumulation, for the term of twenty years;  And <span class='line-break'> </span>that he annually deposit the same <sup>proportion with </sup></p>

<p>Your Comm<sup>ee</sup> have not calculated the<span class='line-break'> </span>amount of interest which would have accrued <span class='line-break'> </span>at the end of twenty years; but they presume <span class='line-break'> </span>that compounded as it would be annually, it <span class='line-break'> </span>would not fall much short <sup>of any</sup> of the amount of <span class='line-break'> </span>capital deposited.  At the expiration of that <span class='line-break'> </span>period, the Corporation would be possessed of a <span class='line-break'> </span>capital of <sup>nearly</sup> two hundred thousand dollars, <del>or there<span class='line-break'></span>about</del>, the income of which would probably de=<span class='line-break'> </span>fray the current expenses. - if however our Suc<span class='line-break'> </span>cessors should find that the current expenses<span class='line-break'> </span>increase so considerably as to excie their apprehen<span class='line-break'></span>sions that the income of two hundred thousand<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars would be insufficient, they will undoubt<span class='line-break'></span>edly take reasonable measures to enlarge the <span class='line-break'> </span>capital by increasing the annual deposits. -<span class='line-break'> </span>Charles P.
