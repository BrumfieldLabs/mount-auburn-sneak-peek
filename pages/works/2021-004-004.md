<p>The Committee to whom was referred the<span class='line-break'> </span>question whether any change is necessary in the <span class='line-break'> </span>mode of admission at the gate, either on week<span class='line-break'></span>ddays or sundays, have attended to their duty<span class='line-break'> </span>and present the following.</p>
<p>-Report-</p>
<p>On the 5<sup>th</sup> of July 1853. a vote was passed, <span class='line-break'> </span>"that the Gate-keeper be permitted to admit <span class='line-break'> </span>persons of respectable appearance and demeanor<span class='line-break'> </span>to ride into the Cemetery without tickets or permits <span class='line-break'> </span>until further order."</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> Article of the Bye-laws provides that <span class='line-break'> </span>"strangers from a distance also persons having business in the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery, may be admitted with carriage on presenting a <span class='line-break'> </span>note or ticket of admission signed by a Trustee or by the <span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary or Treasurer."</p>
<p>The same article also provides that "Persons having <span class='line-break'> </span>a relative or near friend interred there, may enter the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery on Sundays and Holidays, on presenting a <span class='line-break'> </span>card of admission from a Trustee, the Secretary or <span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer."</p>
<p>The Bye-laws also contain a clause in these words<span class='line-break'> </span>"The Trustees however may from time to time pass such<span class='line-break'> </span>votes for the admission of strangers and other non<span class='line-break'></span>proprietors and under such regulations as they may <span class='line-break'> </span>deem expedient"; and another whereby all votes</p>

<p>and regulations which had been previously <span class='line-break'> </span>passed and which were incompatible with the <span class='line-break'> </span>present code of Bye-laws, should be repealed. -</p>
<p>From the preceding citations it appears clearly <span class='line-break'> </span>to the Committee, <u>first</u>, that the Bye-laws contain <span class='line-break'> </span><del>contain</del>regulations and restrictions in regard to <span class='line-break'> </span>admission to the grounds.  <u>Second</u>, That notwithstanding <span class='line-break'> </span>these general limitations, the whole power of <span class='line-break'> </span>regulating the admissionof non-proprietors is vested <span class='line-break'> </span>in the Trustees without reference to the Bye-laws.<span class='line-break'> </span><u>Third</u>, That any vote not incompatible with <span class='line-break'> </span>te Bye-laws, which had been passed prior<span class='line-break'> </span>to their adoption and which has not been <span class='line-break'> </span>repealed, is now extant, and <u>fourth</u>, That <span class='line-break'> </span>the vote of 5<sup>th</sup>July 1853 is not incompatible with <span class='line-break'> </span>the Bye-laws - has not been repealed and <span class='line-break'> </span>therefore is in full force now. -</p>
<p>The question of admission to the Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>is a delicate one. - Mount Auburn, although <span class='line-break'> </span>strictly a private institution, may in some <span class='line-break'> </span>senses be considered a public one. - It is the <span class='line-break'> </span>pioneer of ornamental Cemeteries - the delight <span class='line-break'> </span>and pride of our own citizens and the admiration <span class='line-break'> </span>of strangers - it has caused may other <span class='line-break'> </span>institutions of like character to spring up all <span class='line-break'> </span>over the country, and its fame extends wherever<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston is known. - It is natural therefore</p>

<p>that all strangers visiting this part of the country <span class='line-break'> </span>should be desirous of seeing it, and it is the <span class='line-break'> </span>wish of the Trustees to grant every facility for <span class='line-break'> </span>the gratification of this desire, and also for the <span class='line-break'> </span>accommodation of resident non-proprietors, so far<span class='line-break'> </span>as they can do so in justice to the interests <span class='line-break'> </span>committed to them. -</p>
<p>But while the Trustees desire to grant <span class='line-break'> </span>every privilege to our own citizens and to others <span class='line-break'> </span>who may wish to ride or walk over the grounds <span class='line-break'> </span>for legitimate purposes, they do not wish to <span class='line-break'> </span>open them as a pleasant drive for all pleasure <span class='line-break'> </span>seekers who may chance to pass that way, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the Committee cannot but think, that a mild <span class='line-break'> </span>and reasonable enforcement of the rules, while it<span class='line-break'> </span>will allow all who ought to have the privilege<span class='line-break'> </span>of entering, every facility, will prevent abuses <span class='line-break'> </span>which must otherwise necessarily creep in,. -</p>
<p>It will be born in mind that the number <span class='line-break'> </span>of proprietors now approaches three thousand, -<span class='line-break'> </span>all of whom have the right of admission in <span class='line-break'> </span>carriages; - add to this the surreptitious use of the <span class='line-break'> </span>tickets of proprietors which cannot be prevented, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the tickets issued for single admissions, and an aggregate<span class='line-break'> </span>will be shown quite sufficient to make the grouns <span class='line-break'> </span>as public as can reasonably be required. -<span class='line-break'> </span>The facility of obtaining tickets appears to the </p>

<p>Committee quite sufficiently for strangers and <span class='line-break'> </span>others who may wish to visit the grounds for <span class='line-break'> </span>proper objects, and if each one be obliged to deliver <span class='line-break'> </span>his ticket at the gate, it will render it much <span class='line-break'> </span>easier to detect those who abuse their privileges.</p>
<p>So far as the Committee can learn, the chief<span class='line-break'> </span>abuse is by the drivers of public Hackney Coaches.<span class='line-break'> </span>They drive fast through the grounds with heavy<span class='line-break'> </span>loads, and when spoken to, reply in improper<span class='line-break'> </span>language. -</p>
<p>Looking at the subject in all its aspects <span class='line-break'> </span>the Committee are of opinion, that although the <span class='line-break'> </span>prohibition of some of the privileges which the <span class='line-break'> </span>public have enjoyed may cause some inconvenience <span class='line-break'> </span>and dissatisfacton, yet that a much greater <span class='line-break'> </span>evil would arise if the Cemetery were injured,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the proprietors annoyed by persons <span class='line-break'> </span>merely seeking amusement regardless of injury<span class='line-break'> </span>to others, and as all have the privilege of <span class='line-break'> </span>walking in the grounds, they think of two <span class='line-break'> </span>evils it is better to choose the less, they <sup>therefore</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>recommend the repeal of the vote of the 5<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>of July 1853, granting permission to enter <span class='line-break'> </span>without a ticket. - They would also <span class='line-break'> </span>recommend that the Secretary be directed to <span class='line-break'> </span>furnish tickets to the proprietors of the principal <span class='line-break'> </span>Hotels, for the use of strangers,<sup>in which the name of the visitor shall be inserted</sup>with the</p>

<p>They would also recommend that the <span class='line-break'> </span>Gate-keeper be instructed to require the <span class='line-break'> </span>delivery of all tickets except those of <span class='line-break'> </span>proprietors, at the Gate, and that the same <span class='line-break'> </span>be returned to the Secretary. -</p>
<p>The question has been raised in regard <span class='line-break'> </span>to the clause in the Bye-laws allowing persons<span class='line-break'> </span>having a relative or near friend interred in <span class='line-break'> </span>the Cemetery to enter on sundays and holidays -<span class='line-break'> </span>whether they are allowed to enter in carriages. -</p>
