<p>The Committee to whom was referred the sub<span class='line-break'></span>ject of settling the bounds of Harvard College <span class='line-break'> </span>Lot in M<sup>t</sup> Auburn Cemetery respectfully <span class='line-break'> </span>report, that they <del>have</del>agreed with Amos A. Lawrence,<span class='line-break'> </span>Esqr. Treas<sup>r</sup> of Harvard College that Mr Wadsworth,<span class='line-break'> </span>the cemetery Surveyor, should examine &amp; reestablish <span class='line-break'> </span>the bounds of the lot: &amp; should decide whether the <span class='line-break'> </span>monuments placed without its limits shall be <span class='line-break'> </span>removed<sup>within</sup>them, or a strip of land adjoining be <span class='line-break'> </span>taken sufficient to bring said monuments within<span class='line-break'> </span>the limites of the lot.  In the latter case, a num<span class='line-break'></span>ber of feet of land shall be set off from the <span class='line-break'> </span>Northern extremity of the lot equal to the <span class='line-break'> </span>number added to enclose the monuments:<span class='line-break'> </span>and this shall be an equal exchange, and <span class='line-break'> </span>neither party shall pay or receive any further <span class='line-break'> </span>compensation for the land so exchanged.<span class='line-break'> </span>Harvard College lot runs far down the hill &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>becomes quite narrow at its Northrn termination.<span class='line-break'> </span>No use has as yet been made of this part of the <span class='line-break'> </span>lot, which seems of little value in its present connec<span class='line-break'></span>tion, tho' it might be advantatgeously reunited <span class='line-break'> </span>with ground about it.</p>
