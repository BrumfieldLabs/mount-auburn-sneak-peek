<p>The [subscriber?] appointed a committee<span class='line-break'> </span>to put in order the opening of the drain <span class='line-break'> </span>or culvert leading from Forest to Meadow Pond</p>
<p>Reports - that he has caused the <span class='line-break'> </span>whole of he upper half of Meadow Pond<span class='line-break'> </span>to be excavated by the removal of its <span class='line-break'> </span>mud - and a short stone dam to be <span class='line-break'> </span>placed across the mouth of the drain where <span class='line-break'> </span>it enters this pond.  This is deeply &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>extensively boxed with clay on the inside.<span class='line-break'> </span>The water now rises at this dam to the <span class='line-break'> </span>height of the land of Forest pond &amp;<span class='line-break'> </span>flows over with as small cascade nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>two feet in height.  It is proposed to <span class='line-break'> </span>cover this stream with a marble slab in <span class='line-break'> </span>the form of a shell.  Last  year, the<span class='line-break'> </span>water continued to run over a temporary dam<sup>in this place</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>till about the middle of July.  It is believed <span class='line-break'> </span>that at some future time the supply of water <span class='line-break'> </span>may be increased &amp; prolonged by connecting <span class='line-break'> </span>this drain with the upper part of Garden <span class='line-break'> </span>pond.  Thereafter<sup>also</sup> when the whole of Meadow pond should <span class='line-break'> </span>be cleaned, another fall may be obtained tween its<span class='line-break'> </span>upper &amp; lower half    Jacob Bigelow<span class='line-break'> </span>committee</p>
