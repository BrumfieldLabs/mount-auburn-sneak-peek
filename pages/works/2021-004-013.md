<p>The Committee on Rules and Regulations <span class='line-break'> </span>of Interments &amp;c, having been charged with the <span class='line-break'> </span>duty of ascertaining the necessity or advisability of <span class='line-break'> </span>erecting a building near the gate of Mount Auburn <span class='line-break'> </span>for the convenience of visitors, have had that matter <span class='line-break'> </span>under consideration and would now,</p>
<p>-Report. -</p>
<p>The Committee have given the subject considerable <span class='line-break'> </span>attention - have made examination and inquiries <span class='line-break'> </span>elsewhere - and have arrived at the conclusion that <span class='line-break'> </span>a building of suitable dimensions and with all the <span class='line-break'> </span>conveniences requisite - such as Water-Closets &amp;c - can be <span class='line-break'> </span>erected at a comparatively small expense; -<span class='line-break'> </span>thata the wants of visitors absolutely require such a building;<span class='line-break'> </span>and that it should have early attention from the Trustees. -</p>
<p>While however the Committee see the great necessity <span class='line-break'> </span>for such a building, and that it is an object of <span class='line-break'> </span>the first importance, not only for the convenience of <span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietors and visitors, but for the interest of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery; yet, in view of the large sums which are <span class='line-break'> </span>required to be expended this year for Statuary,<span class='line-break'> </span>Superintendant's House and for other purposes; -<span class='line-break'> </span>and</p>

<p>and also in view of the low state of the <span class='line-break'> </span>funds of the C orporation; they would advise that <span class='line-break'> </span>it be deferred for another year;  but they would <span class='line-break'> </span>earnestly recommend to the Trustees not to lose <span class='line-break'> </span>sight of the importance of the subject, and that <span class='line-break'> </span>the building shoud be erected at as early a <span class='line-break'> </span>date as the state of the finances shall permit it<span class='line-break'> </span>to be done with propriety. -</p>
<p>The Committee look upon this, not as a matter of <span class='line-break'> </span>embellisment without practical use - not <span class='line-break'> </span>as something merely to gratify the eye, but <span class='line-break'> </span>as a thing of absolute necessity which would <span class='line-break'> </span>have greatly promoted the interest of the Corporation, <span class='line-break'> </span>had it have been acco mplished long since. -</p>
<p>In view of the reasons stated above, the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee recommend that the subect for the <span class='line-break'> </span>present be laid on the table -</p>
<p>All of which is respectfully submitted</p>
