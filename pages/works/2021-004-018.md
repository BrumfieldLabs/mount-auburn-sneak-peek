<p>The Committee<sup>appointed</sup> t investigate the mode<span class='line-break'> </span>of keeping the accounts and other duties <span class='line-break'> </span>performed by the Gate Keeper and Clerk,<span class='line-break'> </span>at Mount Auburn, have attended to<span class='line-break'> </span>that duty and submit the following</p>
<p>Report</p>
<p>The Committee made as extended an <span class='line-break'> </span>examination of the books and other documents <span class='line-break'> </span>in the Office as time permitted and were <span class='line-break'> </span>assisted by M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth who gave all the <span class='line-break'> </span>necessary explanations</p>

<p>ascertain the particulars concerning them.</p>
<p>It would not be practicable for the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee with the hasty examination which <span class='line-break'> </span>they were enabled to make, to point out <span class='line-break'> </span>or even to ascertain, all the irregularities <span class='line-break'> </span>which haeve been permitted; - but they would <span class='line-break'> </span>reommend that a rigid scrutiny be instituted <span class='line-break'> </span>and some system adopted whereby all the <span class='line-break'> </span>evils may be remidied in the future. - Too<span class='line-break'> </span>much importance can hardly be attached <span class='line-break'> </span>to this matter in the opinion of the Committee,<span class='line-break'> </span>and they would urge upon the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>not to <del>delay</del><del>or</del> neglect or delay taking the<span class='line-break'> </span>necessary steps in regard to it. -</p>
<p>In justice to M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth the Committee would say, that in <span class='line-break'> </span>their opinion he has done much towards <span class='line-break'> </span>rectifying these errors; but unless a proper<span class='line-break'> </span>system be adopted under the direction of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Board, it will be impossible for any <span class='line-break'> </span>one to do all that is required. -  So <span class='line-break'> </span>far as the Committee could judge M<sup>r</sup> Wyeth <span class='line-break'> </span>appears to be suited to the office which he <span class='line-break'> </span>holds</p>

<p>and they unanimously recommend that the <span class='line-break'> </span>present mode of having as Gatekeeper and <span class='line-break'> </span>Clerk combined in one individiual, appointed <span class='line-break'> </span>by the Trustees, be continued.  - Indeed in <span class='line-break'> </span>their judgment it would be impossible for <span class='line-break'> </span>the business pertaining to the office to be <span class='line-break'> </span>performed unless a person competent to fulfil<span class='line-break'> </span>all the duties should be employed -</p>
<p>One matter particularly attracted the attention <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Committee, and that was that interments<span class='line-break'> </span>are permitted by persons claiming to be <span class='line-break'> </span>undertakers and supposed, but not known<span class='line-break'> </span>to be such, without any permit from the <span class='line-break'> </span>authorities of the town or city from which <span class='line-break'> </span>the body is brought, but merely the request<span class='line-break'> </span>or permit from the proprietor of the lot <span class='line-break'> </span>where it is to be buried. - This needs <span class='line-break'> </span>special attention and directions should be <span class='line-break'> </span>given to have the law - in relation to it<span class='line-break'> </span>strictly enforced. -</p>
<p>the C ommittee would also recommend that <span class='line-break'> </span>the particulars and amounts of the fees</p>

<p>be printed on the backs of the permits,<span class='line-break'> </span>and at the foot "payable at the time of <span class='line-break'> </span>interment." - By adopting this system, much <span class='line-break'> </span>time any many fees which by the present <span class='line-break'> </span>system are lost, would be saved. -<span class='line-break'> </span>this will appear more evident from the fact <span class='line-break'> </span>that when the late Superintendent went <span class='line-break'> </span>out of office, some five or six thousand <span class='line-break'> </span>dollars <sup>were</sup> due to the Corporation on outstanding <span class='line-break'> </span>accounts, some of which had been standing<span class='line-break'> </span>for years and a part of which will <span class='line-break'> </span>probably be lost. - This evil is not <span class='line-break'> </span>so great under M<sup>r</sup>Mann the present<span class='line-break'> </span>Superinendent, but by adopting the proposed<sup>plan</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>it will be entirely cured. -</p>
<p>The Records and other documents at the <span class='line-break'> </span>Office are now very insecurely kept, and <span class='line-break'> </span>in case of fire, might, and probably would <span class='line-break'> </span>be entirely lost, to the great detriment of <span class='line-break'> </span>the corporation, and the Committee recommend <span class='line-break'> </span>that an appropriation of $100- 150 be made<span class='line-break'> </span>for the purpose of procuring a suitable<span class='line-break'> </span>iron<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>The Comittee would remark in passing,<span class='line-break'> </span>that the Office at the gate is very small <span class='line-break'> </span>and that there is no room where visitors <span class='line-break'> </span>can find shelter in case of a storm or <span class='line-break'> </span>for other purposes, and would call the <span class='line-break'> </span>attention of the Trustees to that subject that <span class='line-break'> </span>they may take such action, if any, as <span class='line-break'> </span>their judgment may deem best. -</p>
<p>The Committee would further recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>that a Standing Committee be appointed <span class='line-break'> </span>whose duty it shall be to attend to the <span class='line-break'> </span>matters treated of in this report, and  those <span class='line-break'> </span>of a kindred nature, and to see that <span class='line-break'> </span>all the rules and regulations pertaining to this<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] are faithfully erxecuted. -</p>
<p>The Committee would remark in conclusion<span class='line-break'> </span>that there are many other things of which <span class='line-break'> </span>they cannot speak in this report, but which <span class='line-break'> </span>would properlyt come under the notice of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Committee suggested. -</p>
