<p>The undersigned, to whom was referred the communication <span class='line-break'> </span>of William Brown, dated Cambridge Aug<u>t</u> 4. 1854 respecting<span class='line-break'> </span>the purchase of lot of land lying west of the Cemetery grounds <span class='line-break'> </span>and adjoining the same, containing 6 3/4 Acres, less 7425 feet taken <span class='line-break'> </span>off by the Rail Road, have attended to the duty assigned us</p>
<p>Cambridge Aug<u>t</u> 4 1854</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Since I saw you I have seen the <span class='line-break'> </span>Person who I suppose has the seling of the lot <span class='line-break'> </span>by Mt. Auburn and understand by him that the <span class='line-break'> </span>lot contained at first 5 3/4 acres, afterward, one <span class='line-break'> </span>acre was added making 6 3/4 acres, when the <span class='line-break'> </span>railroad went through, it cut of 7425 ft, his price <span class='line-break'> </span>is $1600 for acre or $10,500 for the lot, that <span class='line-break'> </span>is the best he would say for it, and he seemed<span class='line-break'> </span>quite indifereant at that, and think no doubt <span class='line-break'> </span>it wil bring it.</p>
<p>A Person living near the Street, has said that the <span class='line-break'> </span>Bishop, intends to purchase that spot of ground,<span class='line-break'> </span>whether this is so you will judge</p>
<p>Respectfully yours</p>
<p><u>William Brown</u></p>
