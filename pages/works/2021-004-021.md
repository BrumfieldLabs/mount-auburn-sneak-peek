<p>The Committee to whom was referred the <span class='line-break'> </span>question of the expediency of the purchase by<span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees of Mount Auburn of the lands <span class='line-break'> </span>immediately continguous on the westerly side; have <span class='line-break'> </span>attended to the duty assigned to them and now <span class='line-break'> </span>ask leave to,</p>
<p>-Report-</p>
<p>The Committee have made a personal examin=<span class='line-break'> </span>ation of the premises, and also of those adjoining <span class='line-break'> </span>them.  They have also obtained information in <span class='line-break'> </span>other ways regarding the probably disposition <span class='line-break'> </span>of the land if not purchased by the Trustees.  they <span class='line-break'> </span>learn that one or two projects have been suggested<span class='line-break'> </span>for its disposition;  one of which is that it will <span class='line-break'> </span>be purchased by the Cambridge Horse Rail Road.<span class='line-break'> </span>Should that be the case, they are informed that a <span class='line-break'> </span>house will be erected on the front land, and <span class='line-break'> </span>stables on the rear.  This in the opinion of  the <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee would be very undesirable, inasmuch <span class='line-break'> </span>as there are many valuable lots both bordering <span class='line-break'> </span>upon, and immediately adjacent to the line where<span class='line-break'> </span>the stables would be erected, and which would <span class='line-break'> </span>be materially injured should any nuisance<span class='line-break'> </span>arise therefrom.</p>
<p>Another proejct they understand to be the<span class='line-break'> </span>establishment of anoather Cemetery.  If this be</p>

<p>merely for a protestant burial ground, it <span class='line-break'> </span>would not be so objectionable as it would be<span class='line-break'> </span>if used for an extension of the Catholic burial<span class='line-break'> </span>ground, but even for that purpose it would be <span class='line-break'> </span>rather an injury to Moutn Auburn.  The <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee understand that this project is favored<span class='line-break'> </span>by the inhabitants of Watertown, inasmuch as the <span class='line-break'> </span>town would probably receive a considerable bonus <span class='line-break'> </span>if consent were given, and also an annual tax - neither<span class='line-break'> </span>of which would be paid if the Trustees of Mount<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn should annex it to their land, which they <span class='line-break'> </span>have the right to do, without the consent of the town.<span class='line-break'> </span>It may be however that this project is merely one <span class='line-break'> </span>for the eventual extension of the Catholic ground,<span class='line-break'> </span>that they may have a front alongside of Mount <span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn.  The evils arising rom that are appent <span class='line-break'> </span>to all. -</p>
<p>Were this land bounded by a public road <span class='line-break'> </span>so that if annexed to Mount Auburn no further <span class='line-break'> </span>trouble could arise, the Committee would not <span class='line-break'> </span>hesitate to recommend its immediate purchase, <span class='line-break'> </span>but upon examination they find that only a <span class='line-break'> </span>small part is bounded by the Rail Road,<span class='line-break'> </span>and that that road is likely to be discontinued,<span class='line-break'> </span>and that the residue has other land on its <span class='line-break'> </span>borders comparatively unoccupied, which <span class='line-break'> </span>would form the westerly boundary of Mount <span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn should this land be annexed, so that </p>

<p>there would be no positive assurance that<span class='line-break'> </span>we should not be again interfered with. -<span class='line-break'> </span>While therefore for some reasons this land <span class='line-break'> </span>would be a desirable acquisition, the Committee<span class='line-break'> </span>do not feel justified in recommending its <span class='line-break'> </span>purchase at the price at which it is <span class='line-break'> </span>held, but leave the question for the consideration <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Trutees. -</p>
