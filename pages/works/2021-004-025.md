<p>Boston Feb 2<sup>nd</sup> 1859.</p>
<p>The committee to whom was referred the communi<span class='line-break'></span>cation of the Superintendent of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn respecting <span class='line-break'> </span>deposites in the Receiving Tombs respectfully report;<span class='line-break'> </span>that<del>no</del>by the present regulation $15 must be paid <span class='line-break'> </span>for each deposite &amp; $10 be refunded, if the body be <span class='line-break'> </span>removed to any other place within the Cemetery within <span class='line-break'> </span>four months: but if not removed within that time <span class='line-break'> </span>the Superintendent shall remove said body to such place <span class='line-break'> </span>as shall be assigned by the Com<sup>e</sup>on Grounds.  In this case <span class='line-break'> </span>nothing is received by the Corporation for making the de<span class='line-break'></span>posite &amp; the removal from the tomb; when the [friends?] <span class='line-break'> </span>have failed to make the removal, as the price of a <span class='line-break'> </span>single grave in the public lot is $15.</p>
<p>But if a deposit of $20 be required, &amp; $15 be refunded <span class='line-break'> </span>when the body is removed within four months, the<span class='line-break'> </span>expense of depositing in the Receiving Tomb would <span class='line-break'> </span>be the same as at present - and when the removal <span class='line-break'> </span>is neglected the Corporation will receive a just re<span class='line-break'></span>muneration for the services rendered.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore recommend, that the <span class='line-break'> </span>23<sup>d</sup>section of the Bylaws be so amended as to require<span class='line-break'> </span>the sum of <u>twenty dollars</u>to be paid for each deposit<span class='line-break'> </span>in the receiving tomb, of which <u>fifteen dollars</u> should <span class='line-break'> </span>be refunded, if the body removed within four months, unless the<span class='line-break'> </span>same be removed from the Cemetery, in which case no part thereof<span class='line-break'> </span>shall be refunded.  Respectfully submitted  B. A. Gould}<span class='line-break'> </span>James Cheever} Com</p>
