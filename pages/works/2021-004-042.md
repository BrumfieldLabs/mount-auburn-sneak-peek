<p>The undersigned,<sup>the majority of the Committee</sup><del>who were appointed a</del> <span class='line-break'> </span><sup>appointed</sup><del>Committee</del> to report a plan for insuring the preserva=<span class='line-break'> </span>tion and continuance of the accumulating fund -<span class='line-break'> </span>have considered the subject and ask leave to repott;</p>
<p>That they find that the establish=<span class='line-break'> </span>ment of<del>to</del> the said Fund is an act generally re=<span class='line-break'> </span>ceived with favor by the Proprietors, whom they have <span class='line-break'> </span>conferred with;  and they have no doubt that it <span class='line-break'> </span>will be universally approved, when it is known, <span class='line-break'> </span>that by it the future prosperitiy of the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>will be secured.  With a view to this end, your <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee have taken into consideration the means of <span class='line-break'> </span>securing the <u>perpetual preservation</u> of this safety fund;<span class='line-break'> </span>and after consulting some of the most sagacious pro=<span class='line-break'> </span>prietors, they have come to the conclusion to recom=<span class='line-break'> </span>mend the adoption of an order by the Trustees, -<span class='line-break'> </span>that in all the deeds of lots which shall hereafter <span class='line-break'> </span>be issued, there be inserted a covenant, that this <span class='line-break'> </span>fund shall be increased by yearly additions and <span class='line-break'> </span>by the accumulation of the interest, until it reaches<span class='line-break'> </span>the sum of <del>two</del><sup>one</sup> hundred <sup>&amp; fifty</sup> thousand dollars; <span class='line-break'> </span>when the interest, and that alone, may be applied, <span class='line-break'> </span>if the wants of the Corporation require it, to the pay=<span class='line-break'> </span>ment of the expenses of the Cemetery.  If the <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees in office at that tine shall not need the <span class='line-break'> </span>income of this fund for expenses, they can if they <span class='line-break'> </span>see fit, permit it to accumulate still longer,</p>
<p>In order to carry this design into effect, it will be <span class='line-break'> </span>expedient to amend the proposition adopted January 5<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>1857 by providing, that instead of placing the income <span class='line-break'> </span>at the disposal of the officers at the end of <u>twenty</u><span class='line-break'> </span>years, it shall not be made use of until the accu=<span class='line-break'> </span>mulated capiatal shall amount to the sum before <span class='line-break'> </span>mentioned, namely <del>two</del><sup>one hundred </sup>&amp; fifty<sup/>thousand dollars.</p>
<p>With these views your Committee recommend the <span class='line-break'> </span></p>
