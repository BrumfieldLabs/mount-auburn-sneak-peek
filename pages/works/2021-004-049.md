<p>The Committee appointed to <span class='line-break'> </span>receive assort &amp; count the votes for <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees of Mt Auburn Cemetery <span class='line-break'> </span>have attended to their duty and report</p>
<p>That by reason of the fact <span class='line-break'> </span>that proxies were [represented?] hearing <span class='line-break'> </span>date Jany 30. 1863.  and other proxies <span class='line-break'> </span>hearing date Jan 30<sup>th</sup> &amp; 31<sup>st</sup>1864, and <span class='line-break'> </span>of the further fact that some persons <span class='line-break'> </span>whose names <sup>were on [?] proxies</sup>were found to have cast <span class='line-break'> </span>votes in person at the meeting, and <span class='line-break'> </span>that some persons<sup>represented by proxy</sup> were present and <span class='line-break'> </span>voted who did not endorse their<span class='line-break'> </span>names upon their votes, the Committee <span class='line-break'> </span>found great difficulty in arriving at <span class='line-break'> </span>the true state of the balloting.</p>
<p>There were also 24 votes cast by<span class='line-break'> </span>persons who did not endorse their<span class='line-break'> </span>ballots.</p>
<p>The Committee decided that <span class='line-break'> </span>all votes cast, although not endorsed, <span class='line-break'> </span>should be counted -</p>
<p>They have carefully at several <span class='line-break'> </span>sessions collated the votes cast -</p>
