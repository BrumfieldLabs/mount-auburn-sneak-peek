<p>The minority of the Committee to whom was <span class='line-break'> </span>referred the memorial of M<sup>r</sup> Wyeth, dissenting <span class='line-break'> </span>from the conclusion to which the majority has <span class='line-break'> </span>arrived, and deeming it proper to give the <span class='line-break'> </span>reasons for his dissent, asks leave to submit <span class='line-break'> </span>the following - Report:</p>
<p>The undersigned regrets the necessity of <span class='line-break'> </span>offering views in opposition to his colleagues <span class='line-break'> </span>upon the Committee, who are gentlemen of so <span class='line-break'> </span>much larger experience, and so much his <span class='line-break'> </span>seniors in age, wisdom and learning - and <span class='line-break'> </span>he would premise that he does so with much <span class='line-break'> </span>diffidence - nevertheless he would not on that <span class='line-break'> </span>account shrink from the performance of what he <span class='line-break'> </span>deems to be a plain and simple duty - nor <span class='line-break'> </span>fail to uphold what he believes to be the cause <span class='line-break'> </span>of justice although it may be the unpopular side.<span class='line-break'> </span>He therefore respectfully asks the Board to <span class='line-break'> </span>examine the statements before arriving at their <span class='line-break'> </span>final conclusion. -</p>
<p>This matter is considered by <span class='line-break'> </span>some persons as of very little consequence and that <span class='line-break'> </span>it is unwise, nay improper - to pursue it any<span class='line-break'> </span>further;  and have even insinuated that improper <span class='line-break'> </span>motives have an influence in regard to it.</p>

<p>I suppose it is hardly necessary for me in<span class='line-break'> </span>the outset to discliam <del>having</del><sub>being actuated by </sub>any motives<span class='line-break'> </span>except the desire of having equal and exact<span class='line-break'> </span>justice done to a poor and humbel individual,<span class='line-break'> </span>a stranger to me, except in the short and <span class='line-break'> </span>casual acquaintance which I have had with <span class='line-break'> </span>him officially<sup>prior</sup>and subsequent to his removal,<span class='line-break'> </span>in my capacity of Trustee; - and a desire as <span class='line-break'> </span>one of the members of the Board, to be able <span class='line-break'> </span>to present a clean record to our Constituents <span class='line-break'> </span>and the public.  And this I am sure is the <span class='line-break'> </span>sentiment of the whole Board.</p>
<p>To the Trustees and the Proprietors the change<span class='line-break'> </span>of one Gatekeeper for another, if the new <span class='line-break'> </span>appointed be competent to the duties, is a matter <span class='line-break'> </span>of very little moment - it can be done by a <span class='line-break'> </span>vote, and <del>the</del>forgotten immediately afterwards; -<span class='line-break'> </span>to the individiual it has perhaps a vital importance <span class='line-break'> </span>the extent of which we hardly realize. - Not <span class='line-break'> </span>only the loss of pecuniary emolument - but that <span class='line-break'> </span>of reputation, the jewel which all men <span class='line-break'> </span>should prize, may be involved in it - and <span class='line-break'> </span>can it therefore be considered in any light <span class='line-break'> </span>a small matter for a large Corporation,<span class='line-break'> </span>and particularly one of the sacred chracter <span class='line-break'> </span>of ours, to do any act<del>however</del>of injustice<span class='line-break'> </span>to an individual however humble?<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth was appointed by an unanimous <span class='line-break'> </span>vote, Gatekeeper and superintendent's Clerk.<span class='line-break'> </span>He performed the duties faithfully and was <span class='line-break'> </span>apparently a superior man for the position -<span class='line-break'> </span>possessing a more than ordinary knowledge <span class='line-break'> </span>and capacity for the performance of the duties<span class='line-break'> </span>of that position. - No complaint was made to <span class='line-break'> </span>the Board of want of faithfulness or improper <span class='line-break'> </span>conduct. - So far as it came under my own <span class='line-break'> </span>observation he was at his post at proper times -<span class='line-break'> </span>courteous to strangers - and always evinced a<span class='line-break'> </span>desire to facilitate any improvements in his <span class='line-break'> </span>department. - Such was the position of <span class='line-break'> </span>affairs up to the first meeting of the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>in February 1857. - At that meeting <span class='line-break'> </span>after the Treasurer, Secretary and Superintendent<span class='line-break'> </span>had been elected and the Board were about <span class='line-break'> </span>to proceed to the election of Gatekeeper, it was <span class='line-break'> </span>moved by one of the Trustees, that the appointment<span class='line-break'> </span>of that Officer be laid upon the table.  He was <span class='line-break'> </span>asked for what reason. - He replied for two; one <span class='line-break'> </span>was that M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth had been engaged in obtaining <span class='line-break'> </span>proxies[?] to be used at the annual election of <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees which had been held a short time before, <span class='line-break'> </span>for the purpose of electing new members in place <span class='line-break'> </span>of some of the previous incumbents, and the <span class='line-break'> </span>other was, that we could get a better man for <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>less pay.  The motion very properly prevailed,<span class='line-break'> </span>that time might be given to the gentleman <span class='line-break'> </span>who made the charge, to produce evidence of <span class='line-break'> </span>the fact;  the Board of course reserving to itself <span class='line-break'> </span>to judge afterwards whether the charge if true,<span class='line-break'> </span>should be deemed sufficient cause for so<span class='line-break'> </span>summary a punishment, or whether they <span class='line-break'> </span>would pursue the more magnanimous course <span class='line-break'> </span>of admonishing the offender that a repetition <span class='line-break'> </span>of the offence must be deemed sufficient<span class='line-break'> </span>ground for his discharge. - The matter was <span class='line-break'> </span>accordingly passed over to the next meeting <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Board.</p>
<p>Desirous of obtaining light so tht I could <span class='line-break'> </span>act intelligently and properly at the next <span class='line-break'> </span>meeting, I took steps to ascertain whether <span class='line-break'> </span>the ony charge made against M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth was<span class='line-break'> </span>true. - He told me that it was entirely <span class='line-break'> </span>groundless - that he had not obtained a <span class='line-break'> </span>single proxy - nor made any effort to obtain <span class='line-break'> </span>one - and that he was entirely innocent of <span class='line-break'> </span>anyt thing of the kind. -</p>
<p>At the succeeding meeting of the Trustees, <span class='line-break'> </span>I supposed tht some evidence would be <span class='line-break'> </span>brought to substantiate the charge; but the<span class='line-break'> </span>gentleman who had the election postponed <span class='line-break'> </span>for that reason, then stated that he had not </p>

<p>been able to procure any proof. - Thus the <span class='line-break'> </span>only <u>charge</u> was dropped - and it remained <span class='line-break'> </span>for the Trustees to determine whether the other <span class='line-break'> </span>suggestion, to wit: that teh sercies of another <span class='line-break'> </span>man could be procured at a less price,<span class='line-break'> </span>should determine the Board to dismiss M<sup>r</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>Wyeth and appoint that other man in his <span class='line-break'> </span>pace, and that too without allowing the former <span class='line-break'> </span>the option of retaining the office at the reduced <span class='line-break'> </span>salary. -</p>
<p>It was rather an objectionable feature <span class='line-break'> </span>to some of the Board in regard to the personb <span class='line-break'> </span>proposed to supercede M<u>r</u>Wyeth, that he <span class='line-break'> </span>should endeavor to obtain the situation b <span class='line-break'> </span>offering to perform the duties at a less price <span class='line-break'> </span>than the Corporation were paying at the t ime, <span class='line-break'> </span>or at least</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to say any thing <span class='line-break'> </span>either in regard to the qualifications of M<sup>r</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>Safford, or what is a fair compensation for<span class='line-break'> </span>his services, buat only to allude to the objection <span class='line-break'> </span>raised to M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth, and to inquire whether<span class='line-break'> </span>the Board acted wisely in ejecting him,<span class='line-break'> </span>and generously in refusing to give him a <span class='line-break'> </span>reason therefor. -</p>
<p>If the forgoing statement be <span class='line-break'> </span>correct, is it surprising that M<sup>r</sup> Wyeth - thus <span class='line-break'> </span>thrust from the position which he held, and <span class='line-break'> </span>to which he had been recommended by a <span class='line-break'> </span>number of reputable proprietors - losing a <span class='line-break'> </span>large part of his support and not able to<span class='line-break'> </span>offer any excuise to his friends - or to say whether <span class='line-break'> </span>it was for incompetency or unfaithfulness or <span class='line-break'> </span>both - is it surprising or was it improper <span class='line-break'> </span>that he should address a respectyful <span class='line-break'> </span>note to the President - asking him to inform <span class='line-break'> </span>him in regard to the matter and failing <span class='line-break'> </span>to receive a reply, that he should address <span class='line-break'> </span>a respectful memorial to the Board for the <span class='line-break'> </span>same purpose?  Would it not have been <span class='line-break'> </span>taken as evidence of self-condemnation if he <span class='line-break'> </span>had omitted to do so?

<p>This view of the facts <span class='line-break'> </span>above narrated - if M<sup>r</sup> Wyeth has approached <span class='line-break'> </span>the Board in a respectful and proper <span class='line-break'> </span>manner and if he feels aggrieved  - is it not <span class='line-break'> </span>incumbent upon us in common justice, to allude<span class='line-break'> </span>to no other motive, to at least place him in <span class='line-break'> </span>his true position, and not to let any act of <span class='line-break'> </span>this Board unjustly injure his character?</p>

<p>others who would otherwise employ him, to <span class='line-break'> </span>draw the inferences that something wrong attached <span class='line-break'> </span>to him - but would frankly say what the <span class='line-break'> </span>cause of complaint was; and yet M<sup>r</sup>Wyeth <span class='line-break'> </span>has respectfully requested this Board to assign <span class='line-break'> </span>the reasons for the course they have pursued <span class='line-break'> </span>towards him, and we have quietly informed<span class='line-break'> </span>him that it was not necessary to assign <span class='line-break'> </span>any reason. - In other words, that we possess<span class='line-break'> </span>the power and we exercised it, and are not <span class='line-break'> </span>to be inquired of in regard to it. -</p>
<p>The mere circumstances that at the end of <span class='line-break'> </span>the year the office becomes nominally vacant, has <span class='line-break'> </span>no bearing upon the question at issue - it is<span class='line-break'> </span>well understood that if the incumbent be a <span class='line-break'> </span>suitable one and performs the duties properly,<span class='line-break'> </span>he will ordinarily be re-elected;  although the <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees can if they choose displace him; - and <span class='line-break'> </span>if he be ejected, (the miserable excuse of <span class='line-break'> </span>rotation in office, not prevailing fortunately out <span class='line-break'> </span>of the corrupting circle of politics), and if no <span class='line-break'> </span>reason be vouch-safed for it, is it not in effect <span class='line-break'> </span>either banding him with incompetency or<span class='line-break'> </span>unfaithfulness, or else saying that we acted <span class='line-break'> </span>without any good and sufficient reason or one <span class='line-break'> </span>which we are willing to avow?

<p>the legal element which is infused into this <span class='line-break'> </span>argument and which seems to constitute its <span class='line-break'> </span>chief support, is what I particularly object<span class='line-break'> </span>to - for law and justice are sometimes found <span class='line-break'> </span>to be antagonistic and an act can be defended <span class='line-break'> </span>upon legal grounds, which would not be <span class='line-break'> </span>considered exactly fair and honorable when <span class='line-break'> </span>viewed in the light of simple truth and <span class='line-break'> </span>justice. -  but even the stern letter of the <span class='line-break'> </span>law supposed a man to be innocent until <span class='line-break'> </span>proved guilty and always accords him an<span class='line-break'> </span>opportunity to defence himself - the very idea <span class='line-break'> </span>of stabbing the reputation <del>and the feelings</del>of <span class='line-break'> </span>any one in the dark and there refusing him <span class='line-break'> </span>a chance to vindicate himself, is entirely <span class='line-break'> </span>repugnant to our feelings of honor as individuals <span class='line-break'> </span>and shall we <sup>be</sup> less scrupulous in our corporate<span class='line-break'> </span>capacity?</p>
<p>Hearsay insinuations - personal feeling or <span class='line-break'> </span>prejuidice on the part of any one causing <span class='line-break'> </span>a desire to get a particular individual out <span class='line-break'> </span>of the way -- idle and perhaps causeless rumors <span class='line-break'> </span>constitute no grounds for summary or injust <span class='line-break'> </span>punishment. - They are no valid reason that <span class='line-break'> </span>the incumbent shall be ejected from office. -</p>
