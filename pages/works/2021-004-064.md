<p>The <del>majority of </del> Committee to whom the communication <span class='line-break'> </span>made by Mr. B. F. Wyeth to the Proprietors of Mount <span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn &amp; by them referred to the present Board <span class='line-break'> </span>of Trustees, was referred, have considered the sub<span class='line-break'></span>ject and report; -</p>
<p>The principal matter of the complaint of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mr Wyeth is, that in March 1857 he was dis<span class='line-break'></span>charged from the office of Gatekeeper &amp; Superin<span class='line-break'></span>tendants' Clerk, without any reasons being assigned <span class='line-break'> </span>for his removal;  thus treating him in an ar<span class='line-break'></span>bitrary unjust &amp; illiberal manner, &amp; depriving <span class='line-break'> </span>him  of the right which every American should <span class='line-break'> </span>boast of - that of trial, by a Jury of his countrymen.<span class='line-break'> </span>Of this last Mr. Wyeth has certainly not been <span class='line-break'> </span>deprived, for if he has sustained any wrong <span class='line-break'> </span>upon which a Jury can be entitled to pass, <span class='line-break'> </span>it was not in the power of the Trustees to <span class='line-break'> </span>prevent him from vindicating it.</p>
<p>It is to be obsered that Mr. Wyeth does <span class='line-break'> </span>not ask to be restored to the place from which <span class='line-break'> </span>he says he was arbitrarily &amp; unjustly removed;<span class='line-break'> </span>but he demands a hearing of the charges <span class='line-break'> </span>against him.</p>
<p>It might be sufficient for the present <span class='line-break'> </span>Board of Trustees, to close the consideration of <span class='line-break'> </span>this subject, by stating, that the act com<span class='line-break'></span>plained of was done by a former board , whose</p>

<p>decision was final; &amp; that it would not be suit<span class='line-break'></span>able for us to review &amp; pass upon their conduct;<span class='line-break'> </span>But as most of the individuals who composed <span class='line-break'> </span>that Board are members of the present Board <span class='line-break'> </span>by recent reelection, the Com<sup>ee</sup> think it proper <span class='line-break'> </span>to give their views on the whole matter, as if the <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees were legally, as they are substantially,<span class='line-break'> </span>the same body of men by whom (as Mr. Wyeth<span class='line-break'> </span>complaines) he was wronged.</p>
<p>Your Committee deny that any wrong, <span class='line-break'> </span>properly so called, has been done to Mr. Wyeth.  It <span class='line-break'> </span>is true that our predecessors thought fit in <span class='line-break'> </span>March 1857, not to continue him in the employ<span class='line-break'></span>ment of the Corporation; but they did not re<span class='line-break'></span>move or turn him out of office;  they simply <span class='line-break'> </span>declined to renew an engagement with <span class='line-break'> </span>him; - And they lawfully exercised the authority <span class='line-break'> </span>conferred on them by the Charter "in the general <span class='line-break'> </span>management, superintendance &amp; care of the <span class='line-break'> </span>property expendituires business &amp; prudential con<span class='line-break'></span>cerns of the Corporation" - by employing anoather person.</p>
<p>The reasons which influenced the mind of <span class='line-break'> </span>each member of the late Board in coming to <span class='line-break'> </span>the conclusion that the good of Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>would be promoted by the course they took in<span class='line-break'> </span>not further employing Mr. Wyeth as Gatekeeper<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; Clerk, cannot be &amp; are not known to the Com<sup>ee</sup></p>

<p>Probably they were various: some being operated upon <span class='line-break'> </span>by one reason or more &amp; some by other &amp; different <span class='line-break'> </span>reasons.</p>
<p>No servant of the Corporation has a vested <span class='line-break'> </span>right to his office (any more than the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>themseles)  for any longer time than the Contract <span class='line-break'> </span>with them entitles them to it.  In no view of <span class='line-break'> </span>the facts sdid the Contract with Mr. Wyeth extend <span class='line-break'> </span>beyond February or March 1857 if so long as that.</p>
<p>It is quie clear to the Com<sup>ee</sup> that there was <span class='line-break'> </span>no stipulation with him to employ him for <u>any <span class='line-break'> </span>specified period of time.</u></p>
<p>In the early days of the Institution, <span class='line-break'> </span>the Superintendent kept his accounts without <span class='line-break'> </span>the aid of a Clerk; &amp; the gate was opened by a <span class='line-break'> </span>laborer at $15 per month &amp; his board.  This duty <span class='line-break'> </span>was performed by a faithful Irishman named <span class='line-break'> </span>Shane.  He became infirm &amp; a man named <span class='line-break'> </span>Hyde was employed at $30 a month, without <span class='line-break'> </span>board.  In December 1853, on the death of Hyude, <span class='line-break'> </span>Mr. Wyeth was employed to be Gatekeeper.  In <span class='line-break'> </span>March 1854, the duties of Gatekeep[er were more <span class='line-break'> </span>specifically defined than they had been, &amp; the <span class='line-break'> </span>salary was fixed at $400 per annum payable <span class='line-break'> </span>quarterly, &amp; Mr. Wyeth was continued in this <span class='line-break'> </span>employment;  At the same time (March 1854)<span class='line-break'> </span>the new office of Superintendent's Clerk was created<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>at a salary of $250 a year payable quarterly.  The <span class='line-break'> </span>duties of this place were prescribed, &amp; Mr. Wyeth was <span class='line-break'> </span>employed to perform them;</p>
<p>In June 1855 it was voted that Mr. <span class='line-break'> </span>Wyeth be retained as the Gatekeeper &amp; Superintend<span class='line-break'></span>ent's Clerk, <u>until the further action of the Board<span class='line-break'> </span>of Trustees.</u>  The relations of Mr. Wyeth to the <span class='line-break'> </span>Corporation continued without alteration, till <span class='line-break'> </span>March 1857, when the present Gatekeeper &amp; Clerk <span class='line-break'> </span>was appointed to succed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyeth appears to have supposed that <span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees were not authorized to dispense with <span class='line-break'> </span>his services unless for sufficient cause to be shown <span class='line-break'> </span>by them; - and he claimed a hearing.  It is <span class='line-break'> </span>obvious that a hearing would be fruitless un<span class='line-break'></span>less witnesses could be produced &amp; examined <span class='line-break'> </span>under oath;  The Trustees have no power to sum<span class='line-break'></span>mon witnesses; and if they came before them <span class='line-break'> </span>voluntarily,the Trustees have no authority to <span class='line-break'> </span>administer on oath to them.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees of 1857 on the <span class='line-break'> </span>report of a Comm<sup>ee</sup>, to whom Mr. Wyeths complaint <span class='line-break'> </span>was referred decided that with a view to the <span class='line-break'> </span>good of Mount Auburn they had appointed<span class='line-break'> </span>another person to be the Gatekeeper &amp; that <span class='line-break'> </span>no further measures were by them deemed neces<span class='line-break'></span>sary.  This report was accepted by 7 votes out of [9?]</p>

<p>members present, 2 only<sup>being</sup>absent.  From this action <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Trustees, Mr. Wyeth has appealed to the <span class='line-break'> </span>Holders of Lots. - With these views as to the rights of  the<span class='line-break'> </span>Your Commitee after due delibera<span class='line-break'></span>tion <sup>Trustees &amp; of Mr Wyeth</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>tion are of opinion that the conduct of their pred<span class='line-break'></span>ecessors in regard to Mr. Wyeth was not illiberal <span class='line-break'> </span>unjust or arbitrary; &amp; that if <u>he</u> had a right <span class='line-break'> </span>to a hearing before any other person could be <span class='line-break'> </span>appointed Gatekeeper, every other servant of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees has an equal right to the same <span class='line-break'> </span>privilege.  For the reasons before stated, the Committee de<span class='line-break'></span>cline to inquire whether any or what allegations<span class='line-break'> </span>were made against Mr Wyeth.</p>
<p>Your Committee are further of opin<span class='line-break'></span>ion that the Charter does not allow an ap<span class='line-break'></span>peal to the <u>Lot </u><u>Holders</u> from the action of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Trustees, on matters relating to the man<span class='line-break'></span>agement, superintendance &amp; care of the property,<span class='line-break'> </span>expenditures, business &amp; prudential concerns of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation .</p>
