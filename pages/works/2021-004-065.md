<p>Cambridge Jan'y 29<sup>th</sup> 1858</p>
<p>To the Proprietors of Mount Auburn Cemetery</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>The undersigned<span class='line-break'> </span>would respectfully beg leave to present to you <span class='line-break'> </span>the following facts, in relation to my discharge<span class='line-break'> </span>from the Office of Gate Keeper, and Superintendent's  <span class='line-break'> </span>Clerk, at the Cemetery.</p>
<p>When said office was <span class='line-break'> </span>made vacant by the death of Mr. Hyde, I <span class='line-break'> </span>applied to the Trustees for the same, and <span class='line-break'> </span>received the appointment, by a <u>unanimous</u> <span class='line-break'> </span>Vote of the Board.</p>
<p>I remained in that Office<span class='line-break'> </span>three years, and as I supposed, gave general <span class='line-break'> </span>Satisfaction to the Proprietors, and so far as <span class='line-break'> </span>I knew, there had never been a complaint <span class='line-break'> </span>centered against me, to the Board of Trustees,.</p>
<p>The first knowledge I had of any change <span class='line-break'> </span>in the office I held, was a note from the <span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary, as follows,</p>
<p>Secretary's Office 39 Court St.<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, March 2, 1857</p>
<p>Mr. B. F. Wyeth</p>
<p>Dar Sir</p>
<p>I have to announce that, (over)</p>

<p>Believing that such proceedings <span class='line-break'> </span>would not meet the approbation of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietors, I avail myself of the only alternative <span class='line-break'> </span>and lay the matter before you.
