<p>Your Committee while they do not consider<span class='line-break'> </span>that the aggregate of Salaries paid to the officers <span class='line-break'> </span>is too great, have been struck with the dispro<span class='line-break'> </span>portion between the amounts received and the <span class='line-break'> </span>Services rendered by each - and they are unan<span class='line-break'></span>imously of opinion that the Services of the Super<span class='line-break'></span>intendent whose duties require all his time</p>

<p>and a vast amount of labor and skill have been <span class='line-break'> </span>during the past year by no means as well com<span class='line-break'></span>pensated as those of the Treasurer and Secretary,<span class='line-break'> </span>whose duties require a much less amount of <span class='line-break'> </span>time and labor.</p>
<p>The Committee are also of opinion that a <span class='line-break'> </span>fixed Salary to each of these offices is preferable <span class='line-break'> </span>to the system which has heretofore in part pre<span class='line-break'></span>vailed of compensating the Services of some of them<span class='line-break'> </span>by a commission on receipts and investments <span class='line-break'> </span>and by fees for particular duties performed.</p>
<p>They consider it also highly inexpedient (as<span class='line-break'> </span>leading to abuse and complaints) that any<span class='line-break'> </span>salaried officer of the Corporation, other than <span class='line-break'> </span>the Superintendent should in any case act<span class='line-break'> </span>as agent or broker in negotiating or effecting <span class='line-break'> </span>sales of lots for proprietors.  They consider that <span class='line-break'> </span>the rendering of such services for a fee or <span class='line-break'> </span>reward by an officer of the Corporation should<span class='line-break'> </span>be discouraged as far as possible, but, if they <span class='line-break'> </span>are required in any case, the Superintendent who has the most perfect knowledge of the <span class='line-break'> </span>location, condition and value of lots in this<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetary, is theproper person to be employed -</p>
