<p>Messrs Rand, Norcross &amp; Bowditch<span class='line-break'> </span>Com. on Salaries</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>The enclosed paper <span class='line-break'> </span>accompanying the report of the Com<sup>ee</sup> was <span class='line-break'> </span>originally intended for the inspection of in<span class='line-break'></span>dividual trustees, or of the Board as <span class='line-break'> </span>might be deemed advisable.  Circum<span class='line-break'></span>stances which transpired at the last <span class='line-break'> </span>meeting rendered it unnecessary to <span class='line-break'> </span>present it.  I have neighter the <span class='line-break'> </span>time nor inclination to revise <span class='line-break'> </span>it.  I see no thing which does <span class='line-break'> </span>not fairly state the question.</p>
<p>I am satisfied that <span class='line-break'> </span>my services are worth to<span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation at least <span class='line-break'> </span>fifteen hundred dollars, <span class='line-break'> </span>(over)</p>

<p>and I am persuaded <span class='line-break'> </span>that the Committee will <span class='line-break'> </span>be satisfied that such <span class='line-break'> </span>is the fact, if they will <span class='line-break'> </span>take the opportunity to inquire <span class='line-break'> </span>into m duties and <span class='line-break'> </span>the method of performing <span class='line-break'> </span>them.</p>
