<p>The Committee to whom was referred the matter of <span class='line-break'> </span>compensation to the Secretary have considered <sup>the subject</sup>attentively<span class='line-break'> </span>and now,  Report:</p>
<p>In the early days of the Cemetery when the <span class='line-break'> </span>financial affairs were of such small dimensions as to <span class='line-break'> </span>require but little care, and the clerical work of the <span class='line-break'> </span>company so inconsiderable as to need only occasional <span class='line-break'> </span>attention, the office of Treasurer and Secretary could <span class='line-break'> </span>be filled by persons who had little or no regard to<span class='line-break'> </span>compensation, considering the performance of their duties <span class='line-break'> </span>rather a labor of love than one of business.  At<span class='line-break'> </span>the present time however the matter stands very differently. -</p>
<p>The corporation having grown to be a large one, the <span class='line-break'> </span>details in the management of these offices necessarily <span class='line-break'> </span>consume much time,. - It is important not only <span class='line-break'> </span>to have a Secretary, but that he should give a large <span class='line-break'> </span>part of his time to the affairs of the company; be ready <span class='line-break'> </span>to give all information to the proprietors and them who<span class='line-break'> </span>may wish to become such and to give a constant attention <span class='line-break'> </span>to the affairs of the company so far as relates to his office.-<span class='line-break'> </span>If the Secretary properly performs his duties, they involve<span class='line-break'> </span>the obtaining and imparting information in relation to <span class='line-break'> </span>purchase of lots; - to work; - the general management of affairs by <span class='line-break'> </span>the Corporation, the necessity of explainnig the details of <span class='line-break'> </span>operation and of making proper uxplanation to those</p>

<p>proprietors who may suppose that their wishes or <span class='line-break'> </span>requests have been neglected; - of suggesting to them <span class='line-break'> </span>in a proper manner the advisability of making <span class='line-break'> </span>provision for the perpetual care of their lots <span class='line-break'> </span>involving much time in details in the accom<span class='line-break'></span>plishment of their plans if acceded to; - the <span class='line-break'> </span>issuing of permits for work under the recent rule <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Trustees; - the proper registers of interments; -<span class='line-break'> </span>the examinations at the offices of Registrar of Probate <span class='line-break'> </span>in the different counties to obtain the necessary <span class='line-break'> </span>information in regard to the disposition of estates<span class='line-break'> </span>of deceased proprietors;  by which means also the <span class='line-break'> </span>corporation is apprized of legacies or endowments<span class='line-break'> </span>of lots made by them; and many other things <span class='line-break'> </span>which might be enumerated, but the facts are <span class='line-break'> </span>so obvious that the Committee deem it unnecessary <span class='line-break'> </span>to consume time by a fuller statement of them. -</p>
<p>The present compensation of the Secretary is a salary <span class='line-break'> </span>of $500 and fees amounting to about $130 say [?] $630.<span class='line-break'> </span>From which he pays Rent $150.<span class='line-break'> </span>Care of room &amp; postage  53.<span class='line-break'> </span>Fuel &amp; Light<u>23. </u>     <u>225</u><span class='line-break'> </span>which leaves him a nett income of ...$405.</p>
<p>It will be obvious we think to the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>that no competent man can reasonably be expected <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>to devote the larger part of his time for such a compensation. -<span class='line-break'> </span>We want an officer who shall feel it for his interest to <span class='line-break'> </span>retain the position and render his services as useful <span class='line-break'> </span>as possible to the Corporation, - considering himself <span class='line-break'> </span>as fairly remunerated; - not one who shall perform <span class='line-break'> </span>the duties with as much economy of time and labor <span class='line-break'> </span>to himself as possible, with the idea that the office is <span class='line-break'> </span>looked upon merely as a sinecure and a nominal<span class='line-break'> </span>compensation paid. -</p>
<p>Were we now commencing anew, we should <span class='line-break'> </span>recommend a union of the offices of Treasurer and <span class='line-break'> </span>Secretary, for we beliee that all the duties pertaining <span class='line-break'> </span>to those two, could be performed by one person in a <span class='line-break'> </span>better manner and at less cost than the two can <span class='line-break'> </span>be filled separately. -  The compensation in either <span class='line-break'> </span>case as it now stands is insufficent for a competent <span class='line-break'> </span>person to make it his whole business, and therefore <span class='line-break'> </span>the duties have to be performed as it were incidentally<span class='line-break'> </span>and in connection with other occupations.

<p>we are obliged to pay for two. -  This view of the question,<span class='line-break'> </span>were it before us, could be sustained by very cogent argu<span class='line-break'></span>ments, but we now only refer to it as one deserving <span class='line-break'> </span>attention and which at some future time may have <span class='line-break'> </span>more full consideration and deliberation and we <span class='line-break'> </span>are moved to speak of it in this connection from <span class='line-break'> </span>our conviction of its great importance. -</p>
<p>In conclusion your Committee would say, that <span class='line-break'> </span>it is their opinion that it would be a reasonable <span class='line-break'> </span>compensation to the Secretary to increase his salary <span class='line-break'> </span>to $800 - eight hundred dollars, and they recommend <span class='line-break'> </span>that that sum be paid from the beginning of <span class='line-break'> </span>the present fiscal year leaving all other matters <span class='line-break'> </span>as they are at the present time. -</p>
