<div class="page-content">
<p>The committee to whom was referred the question<span class='line-break'> </span>of the propriety of allowing the Sec<sup>y</sup> some extra compensation <span class='line-break'> </span>for his labor in preparing a new catalogue, having considered <span class='line-break'> </span>the subject,</p>
<p>Report, that they think it unwise fo the Sec<sup>y</sup> to <span class='line-break'> </span>expect, or the Trustees to allow, extra pay for every <span class='line-break'> </span>little service that may be rendered out of the ordin<span class='line-break'></span>ary course of business expected; but they admit that <span class='line-break'> </span>in the present case there has been an amount of labor <span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; use of time beyond what was anticipated, or what <span class='line-break'> </span>was previously known to the Committee, &amp; that this <span class='line-break'> </span>has been attended with some pecuniary loss on the <span class='line-break'> </span>part of the Sec<sup>y</sup> by interfering with his previous en<span class='line-break'></span>gagements in his professional relations -</p>
<p>They therefore recommend that an allowance of <span class='line-break'> </span><u>one hundred dollars</u> be made to Mr Coolidge, <span class='line-break'> </span>with the understanding, that no such extra <span class='line-break'> </span>allowance shall hereafter [?]be made, unless <span class='line-break'> </span>by special agreement made beforehand.</p>
<p>Al lwhich is respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>B. A. Gould<span class='line-break'> </span>for the Committee</p>
