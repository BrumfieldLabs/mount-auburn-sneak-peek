<p>Report.</p>
<p>That in their opinion the Trustees have <span class='line-break'> </span>the power to unite the two offices of Treas<span class='line-break'></span>urer and Secretary, but to do this would <span class='line-break'> </span>probably requiree the alteration of the e<sup>nd</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>article of the By-Laws, &amp; the assent of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietors at the next annual meeting.<span class='line-break'> </span>They do not however at this time recom<span class='line-break'></span>mend this union of the two offices.<span class='line-break'> </span>Neither do they propose any reduction <span class='line-break'> </span>of the salaries heretofore paid, these <span class='line-break'> </span>not being excessive for the amount and <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>character of the work to be performed.<span class='line-break'> </span>They are of opinion however that the <span class='line-break'> </span>office hours should be extended later into <span class='line-break'> </span>the afternoon, and that both Treasurer <span class='line-break'> </span>and Secretary should devote more of<span class='line-break'> </span>their time to the service of the corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>At present the office is closed at 3 P.M., <span class='line-break'> </span>and the Treasurer is accustomed to leave <span class='line-break'> </span>as early as 2 P.M.  They recommend<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Trustees to fix the hour of closing at <span class='line-break'> </span>4 P.M., or even later, if in their judg<span class='line-break'></span>ment it shall seem best.
