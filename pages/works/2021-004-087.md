<p>M<sup>t</sup> Auburn Nov 6<sup>th</sup>1869 /esq<sup>re</sup></p>
<p>Otis Norcross, Esq<sup>r</sup></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your letter under<span class='line-break'> </span>-date 4<sup>th</sup>inst., was duly received! informing me <span class='line-break'> </span>of a Vote passed at the last monthly meeting of the Trustees <span class='line-break'> </span>of Mount Auburn Cemetery,and that a Comittee of<span class='line-break'> </span>3 was appointed to examine &amp; Report to the "board."</p>
<p>"Whether any infringements of the "bye Laws, contained <span class='line-break'> </span>in the last paragraph of Article 3<sup>d</sup> of the Bye laws of the Corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>had been made by me!</p>
<p>That said Committee had been <span class='line-break'> </span>informed, "That I had received commissions from various <span class='line-break'> </span>Granite &amp; Marble Workers, and that in the year 1868 I had <span class='line-break'> </span>receievd $900.<sup>00</sup> for Granite alone, and that further more I <span class='line-break'> </span>exacted a commission on all work done, and materials furnished,<span class='line-break'> </span>by Granite or Marble workers to proprietors of lots in the Cemetery.<span class='line-break'> </span>now as it regards this last accusation!  I unqualified say,<span class='line-break'> </span><u>There is not a Shadow of truth in the assertion</u>!</p>
<p>As it regards the "Bye Laws" to which <span class='line-break'> </span>you refer: and several others, among the same, all of the same<span class='line-break'> </span>import, I will say, I always considered them to be <span class='line-break'> </span>inerpreted, <u>Just</u> <u>as</u> <u>they</u><u> read</u>! :No commission to be received <span class='line-break'> </span>by any officer of the Corporation, on any work, or materials</p>

<p>furnished <u>for the Cemetery></u>! [double underline]</p>
<p>Which "Bye Law in<span class='line-break'></span>-cludes, all Materials purchased for the use of the Cemetery,<span class='line-break'> </span>of every name &amp; nature!  including all hammered Stone for <span class='line-break'> </span>Ornamental Grounds, Coping like Mr Storys! Munson, and <span class='line-break'> </span>all such work for lots held in trust by the Corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>All of which I have scrupulously adhered too !!</p>
<p>For, aside, from the Bye Laws!  I trust my Moral Sense<span class='line-break'> </span>of Justice, would not allow me to make any money out <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Institution, that I am paid to manage as Superintendent,<span class='line-break'> </span>and in the faithful manner which is incumbent on all <span class='line-break'> </span>persons, <u>who</u><u>accept</u><u>such</u><u>Trusts</u>!</p>
<p>As it regards my business with Stone cutters, Marble lWorkers &amp;c, I have by order<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Proprietors made contracts for Stone "Coping"<span class='line-break'> </span>Tomb Fronts, Sarcophagus &amp; Head Stones, which <span class='line-break'> </span>has secured to the Corporation, the work of Setting,<span class='line-break'> </span>Grading, Sodding, and to that extent, that two gangs of <span class='line-break'> </span>masons, are kept constantly at work, which is the most profitable [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>work done by the <sup>corporation</sup> The places are mostly of my own design,<span class='line-break'> </span>as it regards both lots &amp; Facades of tombs, and all the work <span class='line-break'> </span>has been secured to the Corporation this year.  Except 3 lots! and <span class='line-break'> </span>one of them, has cost the Corporation through the ignorance of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Contractor, as much money as would <del>on</del><sup>cost</sup>to set the lot!  All this <span class='line-break'> </span>work has been done by orders of proprietors, and paid for by them, <u>to the Stone<span class='line-break'> </span>cutters themselves</u>! and "Mount Auburn Corporation has had nothing <span class='line-break'> </span>to do with it!  Tis true, I have received a compensation in many <span class='line-break'> </span>cases <sup>from the stone cutters</sup> a <u>gratuity</u><u>offered </u> but, have always gone away from them</p>
