<p>To the President<span class='line-break'> </span>and members of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery Corporation</p>
<p>Gentlemen</p>
<p>The Committee appointed at the meeting of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Proprietors of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn held Feby 7th. 1870<span class='line-break'> </span>have attended to the duties assigned them and beg <span class='line-break'> </span>leave to report. -</p>
<p>By the records of the Secretary of the Corporation, the <span class='line-break'> </span>subject referred to this Committee appears to be <span class='line-break'> </span>restricted to certain modifications of the by-laws<span class='line-break'> </span>in reference to the compensation of the Superintendent <span class='line-break'> </span>made by the Trustees, and an amendment to the <span class='line-break'> </span>same proposed at the meeting of the 7<sup>th</sup> ult.<span class='line-break'> </span>This restriction was not in accordance with the <span class='line-break'> </span>understanding of your committee, one of whom <span class='line-break'> </span>drafted the motion creating the committee.<span class='line-break'> </span>Conceiving that with even this restricted form, the <span class='line-break'> </span>general management of M<sup>t</sup> Auburn is necess<span class='line-break'></span>arily more or less interwoven, your committee<span class='line-break'> </span>have not yet felt themselves at liberty to reject <span class='line-break'> </span>any testimoney bearing upon the interest of the <span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery.  We have however, throughout our <span class='line-break'> </span>investigations, kept two considerations chiefly <span class='line-break'> </span>in view:  Has the Superintendent been in <span class='line-break'> </span>the receipt of commissions levied upon work <span class='line-break'> </span>done for the cemetery, and to what extent?<span class='line-break'> </span>Is it necessary or desirable that he or any paid <span class='line-break'> </span>servant of the Corporation shall be suffered to <span class='line-break'> </span>receive any compensation other than a regular <span class='line-break'> </span>salary?</p>

<p>Your committee have held seven meetings, at <span class='line-break'> </span>all but one<sup>of</sup> which every member has been <span class='line-break'> </span>in constant attendance, and while the above <span class='line-break'> </span>named points have been kept chiefly in view,<span class='line-break'> </span>we have not refused to receive any testimony<span class='line-break'> </span>of responsible parties having any bearing<span class='line-break'> </span>however indirect, upon the general subject.<span class='line-break'> </span>In regard to the two by-laws bearing upon the right <span class='line-break'> </span>of the Superintendent to receive commissions upon <span class='line-break'> </span>work done for the cemetery, your committee may <span class='line-break'> </span>here state that these by laws were drafted, and <span class='line-break'> </span>are at this moment upon the files of the corporation <span class='line-break'> </span>in the hand writing of your venerable President,<span class='line-break'> </span>and were by him designed and understood to <span class='line-break'> </span><u>prohibit</u> any form of commission or pereqisites<span class='line-break'> </span>whatever.  Your committee fail to see how <span class='line-break'> </span>language can well be more explicit.<span class='line-break'> </span>We have good reason to believe such to be also <span class='line-break'> </span>the views of a large majority of the Proprietors <span class='line-break'> </span>of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that in the opinion of<span class='line-break'> </span>members of the board of Trustees these rules <span class='line-break'> </span>admit of a different interpretation from <span class='line-break'> </span>that designed by those who framed them, and <span class='line-break'> </span>that the Trustees assume the responsibilitiy of <span class='line-break'> </span>this interpretation on the part of the Superint<span class='line-break'> </span>endent.

Nor are we able to agree<span class='line-break'> </span>with them in regard to their proposal to <span class='line-break'> </span>sanction the remuneration of any paid servant <span class='line-break'> </span>of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn by commissions in any form.<span class='line-break'> </span>Your Committee met for organization Feby 15<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>at which meeting it ws unanimoously agreed <span class='line-break'> </span>to invite the attendance of the Superintendent <span class='line-break'> </span>and a gentleman not now, but recently a <span class='line-break'> </span>member of the board of Trustees, and who <span class='line-break'> </span>had declined to subscribe to the Report<span class='line-break'> </span>exonerating the Superintendent.<del>and for this</del><span class='line-break'> </span><sup>To hear from the above named Gentleman</sup> <span class='line-break'> </span>Committee<del>purpose</del> met again on the 17th, And here <span class='line-break'> </span>your committee would state that all our <span class='line-break'> </span>testimony has been necessarily ex parte, All were <span class='line-break'> </span>invited to attend who appeared able to impart<span class='line-break'> </span>reliable information, and all were received who <span class='line-break'> </span>voluntarily offered.

<p>listen to such as voluntarily attended.  Your <span class='line-break'> </span>committee could not anticipate the testimony <span class='line-break'> </span>before it was offered, nor determine the entire <span class='line-break'> </span>credibility of our witnesses.  Not being a judicial <span class='line-break'> </span>tribunal, and with only limited powers, we have <span class='line-break'> </span>only attempted a general investigation.  At the <span class='line-break'> </span>meating on the 17th Mr Cheever, recently a member <span class='line-break'> </span>of the board of Trustees informed your committee <span class='line-break'> </span>that to the best of his knowledge, the present system <span class='line-break'> </span>of commissions originated with the present superin<span class='line-break'></span>tendent.  He estimated the value of these commissions<span class='line-break'> </span>at a very large amount per An<sup>n</sup>um.  He had been <span class='line-break'> </span>informed by several stone-Cutters that they paid <span class='line-break'> </span>the superintendent commissions, but, except in <span class='line-break'> </span>regard to one party, he could only obtain<del>the most</del><span class='line-break'> </span>general information.  the exact amount he was <span class='line-break'> </span>never able to acertain.  At the same meeting <span class='line-break'> </span>the Superintendent appeared, and testified touching <span class='line-break'> </span>his commissions.  From his own testimony it appears <span class='line-break'> </span>that Cap<sup>t</sup> has been in office since 1861 - that <span class='line-break'> </span>he came into office with the full knowledge of the <span class='line-break'> </span>complaints against his predecessor, but had never <span class='line-break'> </span>supposed that his predecessor, in receiving com<span class='line-break'></span>misions, had violated any rules of the Corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>During his first seventeen months Capt Winsor<span class='line-break'> </span>received no commissions of any kind, and he <span class='line-break'> </span>claimed that when he first began to receive <span class='line-break'> </span>any commissions, that they were forced upon him </p>

<p>by contractors, that he never exacted them, that for <span class='line-break'> </span>the past seven years he had been in the receipt of <span class='line-break'> </span>commissions of five percent, upon all contracts for <span class='line-break'> </span>Stone work with which he has had any connection<span class='line-break'> </span>as also for marble and free-Stone.  Of this he says <span class='line-break'> </span>he has kept no account, and is unable to give any <span class='line-break'> </span>estimates to its amount.  During these seven years <span class='line-break'> </span>he thinks he <sup>may</sup> have received $3,000 from one party,<span class='line-break'> </span>$2,000 from another , and other sums from other partys.<span class='line-break'> </span>His commissions may have been $1500 per annum,<span class='line-break'> </span>or more.  By his lowest estimate they must have<span class='line-break'> </span>reached during these seven years the gross amount <span class='line-break'> </span>of $10,500.  It also appears from his testimony that,<span class='line-break'> </span>beside these sums derived from commissions, the <span class='line-break'> </span>compensation allowed by the Trustees was a salary <span class='line-break'> </span>of $2,500, and the free rent of house, use of a<span class='line-break'> </span>horse and carriage, the labor of one man, a cow<span class='line-break'> </span>had his fire wood.  Your committee thus received <span class='line-break'> </span>from the Superintendent the free admission that <span class='line-break'> </span>a regular system existed by which  commissions <span class='line-break'> </span>were by him received upon a large portion of <span class='line-break'> </span>the Stone, Marble, and free-stone work executed<span class='line-break'> </span>for the Proprietors of M<sup>t</sup> Auburn.  Having been <span class='line-break'> </span>able to obtain only a general estimate of its am<span class='line-break'></span>ount, we conceived it to be important to ascertain <span class='line-break'> </span>the exact sum this received.  We therefor invited <span class='line-break'> </span>the several Stone workers, from whom Capt Winso <span class='line-break'> </span>acknowledge he had been in receipt of <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>commissions to meet with your committee <span class='line-break'> </span>Feby 21.<sup>st</sup>  To the regret and disappointment of your <span class='line-break'> </span>committee, with the single exception of Mr. McDonald, <span class='line-break'> </span>none of these parties took any notice of our invitation,<span class='line-break'> </span>and none have given us any information.

Upon the testimony of Mr<span class='line-break'> </span>McDonald your committee need not dwell at any <span class='line-break'> </span>length.  It was chiefly important as showing by <span class='line-break'> </span>memoranda from the books of his firm that <span class='line-break'> </span>during one year, that of 1868, he had paid <span class='line-break'> </span>Capt Winsor commissions to the amount of $944, 50/100<span class='line-break'> </span>of this sum Mr McDonald declared that a certain <span class='line-break'> </span>amount had been exacted upon work in which <span class='line-break'> </span>Capt Winsor had had no interest, and <sup>that</sup>additional <span class='line-break'> </span>commissions to the amount of $228 - had been deman<span class='line-break'> </span>ded for similar cases but which he had refused.<span class='line-break'> </span>For this refusal, and for no other conceivable reason,<span class='line-break'> </span>he assured your committee he had been refused <span class='line-break'> </span>work in M<sup>t</sup>Auburn by the Superintendent, Mr Mc<span class='line-break'> </span>Donald was also positive that the paymenat of comm<span class='line-break'> </span>issions by him was not voluntary, but had been <span class='line-break'> </span>in all instances forced upon him under penalty <span class='line-break'> </span>of loss of business.

<p>the next meeting, and the time was occupied <span class='line-break'> </span>by having parties aggrieved by ill treatment on <span class='line-break'> </span>the part of the Superintendent.

<p>and all of which come from parties so entirely trustworthy,<span class='line-break'> </span>can have had their origin other than in a lack of <span class='line-break'> </span>proper courtesy on the part of your Superintendent.<span class='line-break'> </span>In<sup>the</sup>course of our investigations it appeared from the <span class='line-break'> </span>testimony of a witness, and the books of the Corporation, that <span class='line-break'> </span>a discount of nearly one half of the cost of the material <span class='line-break'> </span>used in a lot did not accrue to the benefit of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Proprietor, but went into the treasury of the corporation.<span class='line-break'> </span>We therefore recommend to the Trustees, to allow the Proprie<span class='line-break'> </span>tors the full advantage of all discounts made upon <span class='line-break'> </span>materials.  In conclusion your committee are of the <span class='line-break'> </span>opinion that the only safe rule of conduct in the <span class='line-break'> </span>management of M<sup>t</sup>Auburn consist in the <u>entire</u><span class='line-break'> </span>prohibition of  commissions of every kind and nature.<span class='line-break'> </span>This conviction on our part has only been deepened  the<span class='line-break'> </span>more we have had considered the subject, and we recomm<span class='line-break'></span>end that their prohibition be made by rules so clear<span class='line-break'> </span>and stringent as never again to seem to admit of <span class='line-break'> </span>dispute.  For no matter how exact may be the <span class='line-break'> </span>guarantees and safeguards seemingly thrown around <span class='line-break'> </span>the exceptions, - no matter how plausible may seem the <span class='line-break'> </span>reasons for making them, the slightest deviation from <span class='line-break'> </span>the one only safe path opens wide the door for corruption <span class='line-break'> </span>on the one hand, and suspicion, distrust and want <span class='line-break'> </span>of confidence on the other.  We can see no necessity, -<span class='line-break'> </span>we can find no occasion for this most objectionable <span class='line-break'> </span>form of remuneration. - Every Proprietor should have <span class='line-break'> </span>all the advice, aid and cooperation he may require</p>
