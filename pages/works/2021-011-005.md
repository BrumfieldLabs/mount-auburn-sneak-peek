<p>[Letterhead: (P.O.) Mount Auburn, Mass.,] Sept 13, 1870</p>
<p>Dr. Jacob Bigelow,<span class='line-break'> </span>Chairman Comm. on Grounds.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In obedience to the<span class='line-break'> </span>instructions of your Committee of the 19<sup>th</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>ult<sup><u>o</u></sup>, I have the honor to report as follows<span class='line-break'> </span>concerning the best mode of finishing<span class='line-break'> </span>a portion of the new <u>Receiving Tomb</u>.</p>
<p>The <u>front</u> of the tomb, as<span class='line-break'> </span>is well known to your Committee, (with the<span class='line-break'> </span>exception of the urn and ornamental appendages,)<span class='line-break'> </span>is already set up in place. The<span class='line-break'> </span><u>freestone trimmings</u> for vestibule and cata<span class='line-break'></span>combs are delivered on the spot. A<span class='line-break'> </span>considerable portion of the marble doors<span class='line-break'> </span>for catacombs are on hand.</p>
<p>The only other materials<span class='line-break'> </span>required are slate slabs for the floors<span class='line-break'> </span>of the compartments, and bricks. The</p>

<p>Bricks can, of course, be procured at any<span class='line-break'> </span>time. The slate slabs<span class='line-break'> </span>ought to be in <u>one piece</u>, (not in two pieces,<span class='line-break'> </span>as generally used in private tombs,) and<span class='line-break'> </span>of extra thickness. These<span class='line-break'> </span>could not be procured ready made, and<span class='line-break'> </span>it would probably take a month to<span class='line-break'> </span>get them.</p>
<p>It would no doubt<span class='line-break'> </span>be <u>possible</u> to complete the vestibule<span class='line-break'> </span>and one compartment, as proposed, this<span class='line-break'> </span>fall, by extra diligence. But,<span class='line-break'> </span>as we should have to hire new and un<span class='line-break'></span>tried workmen, as we should be liable to<span class='line-break'> </span>delay in getting the slate, and as, at<span class='line-break'> </span>best, the work would not have proper<span class='line-break'> </span>time to dry before frost, -- I could<span class='line-break'> </span>respectfully recommend that the <u>super</u>-<span class='line-break'> </span><u>structure</u> or brick work be not com<span class='line-break'></span>menced this fall, but that the<span class='line-break'> </span>whole or a part of the <u>foundation</u> be<span class='line-break'> </span>put in this fall, (if it turns out<span class='line-break'> </span>to be economical and convenient with<span class='line-break'> </span>respect to other work;) and that all<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>preparations be made in the winter<span class='line-break'> </span>for commencing the work at the<span class='line-break'> </span>opening of Spring. It can<span class='line-break'> </span>then be finished early in the <span class='line-break'> </span>summer, and have the rest of the<span class='line-break'> </span>season to dry.</p>
<p>(Shall our men be<span class='line-break'> </span>too busy this fall to conveniently put in <span class='line-break'> </span>this foundation, it can be done as well<span class='line-break'> </span>in the Spring, being only the work of a<span class='line-break'> </span>few days.)</p>
<p>As I have only seen<span class='line-break'> </span>the plans for a few days past, I am<span class='line-break'> </span>not prepared to report now, in full, my<span class='line-break'> </span>opinion upon all the details of the plan,<span class='line-break'> </span>or upon the general structure and uses of<span class='line-break'> </span>the tomb. One consideration,<span class='line-break'> </span>however, occurs to me. If it<span class='line-break'> </span>be proposed to <u>sell</u> or <u>perpetually lease</u><span class='line-break'> </span>a portion of the catacombs of this tomb,<span class='line-break'> </span>(and I think that might be done with<span class='line-break'> </span>profit,) it may be best to build<span class='line-break'> </span><u>now</u> <u>two</u> compartments of the tomb, <span class='line-break'> </span>(besides the vestibule;) so as to have one</p>
