<p>Boston Feb 1st [1863]</p>
<p>W<sup>m</sup>. W. Story Esq.</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I address you in be<span class='line-break'></span>half of the Trustees of the Cemetery<span class='line-break'> </span>of Mt Auburn. It is not neces<span class='line-break'></span>sary to remind you of the be<span class='line-break'></span>quest by<sup>your father</sup>the late [Snr?] Justice<span class='line-break'> </span>Story, to the Trustees for the pur<span class='line-break'></span>pose of keeping in repair <span class='line-break'> </span>the monument erected by him<span class='line-break'> </span>in his lot and its [?] [appearances?];<span class='line-break'> </span>the income of the Fund<span class='line-break'> </span>unexpended has been added<span class='line-break'> </span>to the principal &amp; now amounts<span class='line-break'> </span>to a considerable surplus.</p>
<p>It is proposed, with your con<span class='line-break'></span>sent, to surround the Lot with<span class='line-break'> </span>a wrought granite curb of<span class='line-break'> </span>the best material ornament<span class='line-break'></span>ed at the corners with Urns<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>of the same material, on the<span class='line-break'> </span>side towards the Avenue there<span class='line-break'> </span>would be a gateway or opening<span class='line-break'> </span>approached by steps<sup>but no gate</sup> There is<span class='line-break'> </span>at present a difference of level<span class='line-break'> </span>between the upper &amp; lower parts<span class='line-break'> </span>of the Lot it is proposed to<span class='line-break'> </span>raise the <del>lower</del> lower position<span class='line-break'> </span>&amp; depress the higher so that<span class='line-break'> </span>the lot shall present a plane,<span class='line-break'> </span>slightly inclined. It is thought<span class='line-break'> </span>that these alterations will be<span class='line-break'> </span>a great improvement in<span class='line-break'> </span>the appearance of the Lot. We<span class='line-break'> </span>have caused a plan to be drawn<span class='line-break'> </span>on tissue paper for your ex<span class='line-break'></span>amination. If this proposal<span class='line-break'> </span>is agreeable to you either with<span class='line-break'> </span>or without alterations will you<span class='line-break'> </span>communicate your assent<span class='line-break'> </span>to me,<sup>with such alterations as you desire</sup>as soon as you can con<span class='line-break'></span>veniently. You will observe</p>
<p>that the urn is surrounded by<span class='line-break'> </span>a carved ivy leaf &amp; surround<span class='line-break'></span>ed with a pine cone, if these<span class='line-break'> </span>ornaments are not agreeable<span class='line-break'> </span>to you, they can be dispensed<span class='line-break'> </span>with &amp; others substituted. Perhaps<span class='line-break'> </span>you would like to have your <span class='line-break'> </span>family name or your father's<span class='line-break'> </span>name at length carved in bas<span class='line-break'></span>relief on the stone; if you<span class='line-break'> </span>should, please to indicate the<span class='line-break'> </span>spot where it shall be placed.<span class='line-break'> </span>The cost of these improvements<span class='line-break'> </span>will not be far from $1000, the<span class='line-break'> </span>whole of which will be defrayed<span class='line-break'> </span>by the Trustees;<sup>from the surplus accumulated on the fund. </sup>care will be taken<span class='line-break'> </span>not to disturb the remains which<span class='line-break'> </span>are deposited nor the monument.</p>
<p>I need not add that this movement on<span class='line-break'> </span>the part of the Trustees arises from their care of<span class='line-break'> </span>what is due<sup>from them</sup>to the memory of your father --</p>
