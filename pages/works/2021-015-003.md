<p>Judge Story's Lot.</p>
<p>Charles P Curtis Esq<sup>re</sup></p>
<p>Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mount Auburn, February 18th. 1863</p>
<p>Charles P Curtis Esq<sup>re</sup><span class='line-break'> </span>Boston</p>
<p>Dr Sir</p>
<p>Herewith I send<span class='line-break'> </span>you a tracing of Mr. Williams plan for the Lot<span class='line-break'> </span>of the late Judge Story; and as you may desire<span class='line-break'> </span>to give him the dimensions of the lot together<span class='line-break'> </span>with the dimensions of stone work I send you<span class='line-break'> </span>the following. The front line is 23 feet, the side<span class='line-break'> </span>or depth of the lot is 19 feet.</p>
<p>The Gate, and all<span class='line-break'> </span>other posts are 22 inches diameter, and are hammered<span class='line-break'> </span>down 2 feet, the Rails are 10 inch thick with an<span class='line-break'> </span>Ogee moulding on top, and show a face of 20 inches<span class='line-break'> </span>above the sodding. The Buttresses and border Stone<span class='line-break'> </span>are 9 inches thick, and<sup>the latter</sup>[runs?] a little in width<span class='line-break'> </span>on account of the decent of the path. The posts<span class='line-break'> </span>in the Border are Sixteen inches in diameter<span class='line-break'> </span>It is to be made of the best dark blue Quincy Granite<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>from [Chapins?] ledge which I prefer to all others<span class='line-break'> </span>on account of its beauty being a rich mottle<span class='line-break'> </span>and perfectly free from [iron?].</p>
<p>I am much<span class='line-break'> </span>pleased with the design and think when<span class='line-break'> </span>done, it will not be surpassed by any lot<span class='line-break'> </span>in Mt. Auburn.</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours</p>
<p>Daniel L. Winsor</p>
<p>P.S. The Rails are to be in one piece of<span class='line-break'> </span>Stone, except the back line will be cemented<span class='line-break'> </span>in the middle on account of its great length</p>
<p>Mr. Williams who designed the plan<span class='line-break'> </span>is the Contractor, and is a [practical?]<span class='line-break'> </span>Stone cutter</p>
