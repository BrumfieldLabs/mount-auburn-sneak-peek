<p>Letter of<span class='line-break'></span>W.W. STory -<span class='line-break'> </span>1863 - Ap 20</p>
<p>April 20 1863</p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>I have received  your letter <span class='line-break'> </span>containing a plan of a wrought granite <span class='line-break'> </span>curb with which the Trustees of Mt<span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn Cemetery propose, in honor <span class='line-break'> </span>of my Father's memory, to surround<span class='line-break'> </span>his lot at Mt. Auburn, and I <span class='line-break'> </span>beg [therefor?] You to express to them <span class='line-break'> </span>my most grateful acknowledgments <span class='line-break'> </span>The plan seems to me excellent, and <span class='line-break'> </span>the only alteration which I would <span class='line-break'> </span>suggest relates to the form of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Vase - It strikes me that were it <span class='line-break'> </span>taller &amp; slenderer the effect would be <span class='line-break'> </span>better - and I accordingly enclose to<span class='line-break'> </span>you a rough sketch of a different <span class='line-break'> </span>Vase for the consideration of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees - The ivy leaf could be <span class='line-break'> </span>carved upon it as an ornament <span class='line-break'> </span>as you propose - and if thought best <span class='line-break'> </span>the handles could be omitted.  If</p>

<p>the Vase in the plan should be <span class='line-break'> </span>preferred, I would suggest that it <span class='line-break'> </span>be made higher &amp; slenderer in proportion.</p>
<p>All the sugegstions you make <span class='line-break'> </span>seem to be so well considered as <span class='line-break'> </span>to leave me nothing more to say than <span class='line-break'> </span>again to thank you for your thought<span class='line-break'></span>ful kindness -</p>
<p>I have the honor to be <span class='line-break'> </span>Your obdt Servant<span class='line-break'> </span>W. W. STory</p>
