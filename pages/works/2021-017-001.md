<p>G. Howland Shaw<span class='line-break'> </span>on Mt Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Imprisonment after sunset - <span class='line-break'> </span>Aug. 27, 1855</p>
<p>Brookline, August 27<sup>th</sup>/55</p>
<p>My dear sir, <span class='line-break'> </span>I desire to call your <span class='line-break'> </span>attention to a matter which I <span class='line-break'> </span>know is of interest to you - <span class='line-break'> </span>Being at Mount Auburn last <span class='line-break'> </span>evening, I staid rather later than<span class='line-break'> </span>usual, and found myself <span class='line-break'> </span>locked in - I thereby learned that <span class='line-break'> </span>after sunset, there in no one (not<span class='line-break'> </span>even a common labourer) left upon <span class='line-break'> </span>the grounds in charge of the many <span class='line-break'> </span>interests that centre there -</p>
<p>Perhaps the Directors are aware<span class='line-break'> </span>of this fact, although I think <span class='line-break'> </span>that can hardly be they are - but it <span class='line-break'> </span>was with a good deal of sacrifice,<span class='line-break'> </span>I may say, pain, that I discovered<span class='line-break'> </span>it, and I find that with the <span class='line-break'> </span>few to whom I have mentioned</p>

<p>it, the impression is the same - <span class='line-break'> </span>I have therefore thus taken<span class='line-break'> </span>the liberty of bringing the <span class='line-break'> </span>subject to your notice, knowing<span class='line-break'> </span>that if action be neccesary, <span class='line-break'> </span>you would gladly see to it -</p>
<p>Thought to add that my <span class='line-break'> </span>own Imprisonment was not a <span class='line-break'> </span>very long or inconvenient one, <span class='line-break'> </span>and by going to a house in <span class='line-break'> </span>the vicinity, I found means<span class='line-break'> </span>to release my [horse &amp; wagon?] -</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Sir, <span class='line-break'> </span>Very truly &amp; Respy<span class='line-break'> </span>Yours, <span class='line-break'> </span>Gardiner Howland Shaw</p>
<p>Doctor Bigelow<span class='line-break'> </span>[?] </p>
