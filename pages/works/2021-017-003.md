<p>Fitchburg Rail Road Office<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston April 4 1853</p>
<p>Jacob Bibelow Md.<span class='line-break'> </span>President</p>
<p>Dear Sir<span class='line-break'> </span>The (?) on the<span class='line-break'> </span>Watertown Branch Railrod is very near one corner of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Mt auburn Cemetery. A great many people who go<span class='line-break'> </span>to + from the Cemetery by Railroad would be much better accommodated<span class='line-break'> </span>by being allowed to pop in  &amp;  out at or near that corner than they <span class='line-break'> </span>now are. I am told that a suitable gate would cost but little,<span class='line-break'> </span>and as the Fitchburg Railroad would probably derive some benefit<span class='line-break'> </span>from the increased facility of getting from the (?) Station to <span class='line-break'> </span>the Cemetery and vice versaw, which a gate at that place would afford,<span class='line-break'> </span>they will pay for erecting one. They will also make it a part <span class='line-break'> </span>of the duty of their agent there to open + close the gate.</p>
<p>I beg you will submit this matter ot the consideration of the Trustees.<span class='line-break'> </span>I hope they will consent to the erection of a gate.<span class='line-break'> </span>(?) Supt. F. R.R.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
