<p>To the gentlemen Committee for building a stockade fence<span class='line-break'> </span>around Mount Auburn,</p>
<p>Dear Sirsl,  I have carefully examined <span class='line-break'> </span>the bills presented to you for payment, the second time, and were <span class='line-break'> </span>the whole subject left to me to decide, I should present you a bill<span class='line-break'> </span>similar to the following.<span class='line-break'> </span>[Note: in pencil on left margin<span class='line-break'> </span>Bryant 3830 f]</p>
<p>Say to building 3797 feet of stockade fence}<span class='line-break'> </span>and furnishing materials as per contract}  5619 56<span class='line-break'> </span>digging trench on the road 1010 feet at 10 cts 101 00<span class='line-break'> </span>for setting and taking down 215 feet of fence}<span class='line-break'> </span>at 25 cts} 53  75<span class='line-break'> </span>carting do from road to rear at 6 cts 12  90<span class='line-break'> </span>loss of profit on 1600 feet of fence at 28 cts 448  00<span class='line-break'> </span>Extra work in crossing bog, say 150 days at $2  300 00<span class='line-break'> </span>extra materials used in crossing bog  60 00<span class='line-break'> </span>all other extra expenses  <u>100 00</u><span class='line-break'> </span>$6695  2.1</p>
<p>The specifications required the fence to be built tight eight feet <span class='line-break'> </span>high by having the pales well fitted together, but by consent they <span class='line-break'> </span>were allowed to be set one inch apart, but they will average more <span class='line-break'> </span>than 1 1/2 inches apart, in consequence of which they gain  474<span class='line-break'> </span>feet, which gives them an advantage of about seven hundred<span class='line-break'> </span>dollars unless accounted for.</p>
<p>In making the estimate on the extra work, if I have erred, it certainly<span class='line-break'> </span>must be on the side of the builders.<span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn  Dec 14<sup>th</sup> 1849<span class='line-break'> </span>Respectfully, your Servant, Rufus Howe<span class='line-break'> </span></p>
