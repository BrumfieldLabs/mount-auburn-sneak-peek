<p>G. F. Bryant. Archt.</p>
<p>Sir.  The estimated cost of the al<span class='line-break'></span>teration of the fence at Mount Auburn will be as follows.</p>
<p>Estimate</p>
<p>Digging (already done) 1010 feet at <sup>100?</sup>cts  $101.00<span class='line-break'> </span>Settiang and taking down 215 " mew femce ..25 cts  53.75<span class='line-break'> </span>Carting do from the road to the rear [?gate]  6 " 12..90.<span class='line-break'> </span>Loss of profit on 1600 feet of fence and extra<span class='line-break'> </span>cost of building the remainder in the woods at 28 cts. 448.00<span class='line-break'> </span>The cost of the cedar posts. (they having been all cut<span class='line-break'> </span>last winter) including wharfing and carting (1600<span class='line-break'> </span>feet of which will not be wanted) is. 98 cts pr.ft + <u>1568.00</u><span class='line-break'> </span>$2183.65</p>
<p>From the above amount will have to be deducted,<span class='line-break'> </span>the sum that this 1600 feet of posts will produce<span class='line-break'> </span>by selling them.  This in all probability will be as <span class='line-break'> </span>much or nearly so, as the first cost of the same.</p>
<p>The cost of the fence according to the new <span class='line-break'> </span>plan, will be 1.25 per lin\eal foot.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours<span class='line-break'> </span>Obt. Servt.<span class='line-break'> </span>(signed) Bryant &amp; Blaisdell.</p>
