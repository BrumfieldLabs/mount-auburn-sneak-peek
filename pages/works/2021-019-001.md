<p>The special committe to whom referred the<span class='line-break'> </span>applications of H. W Muzzery and J. G. Coolidge for payment<span class='line-break'> </span>of damages casued to their estate by grading <span class='line-break'> </span>Coolidge Ave by the City of Cambridge in 1869 submit<span class='line-break'> </span>the following report.</p>
<p>In the year 1862, a claim made that this Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>was bound to grade and repair the avenue was<span class='line-break'> </span>referred to [illegible] C. P. Curtis and E. T. Rand, and from<span class='line-break'> </span>their full examination and report we find, that the <span class='line-break'> </span>fee of the avenue is in this Corporation, that it was laid <span class='line-break'> </span>out as a private way in 1830 and has since been open<span class='line-break'> </span>to public travel. It is not a public way except by  [illegible].<span class='line-break'> </span>Since 1846 no way can be made public  [illegible]<span class='line-break'> </span>laid out by the public authorities. As the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>as lately as 1848 exercised its power of granting rights<span class='line-break'> </span>in the way it seems clear it has never  [illegible] a public <span class='line-break'> </span>way bu didication.</p>
<p>The original agreement between  [illegible] and<span class='line-break'> </span>Josiah Coolidge provided that this way should be <span class='line-break'> </span>kept open and unobstructed, and that said Cooledge<span class='line-break'> </span>his heirs and assign shoud at all times have free<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>ingress and regress to and from his adjoining land into<span class='line-break'> </span>said way.  H. W. Muzzey,  J. G. Coolidge, the petitioners<span class='line-break'> </span>and the City of Cambridge, all claim rights in the way<span class='line-break'> </span>as assigns of J. Coolidge.</p>
<p>In 1868 the way being out of repair the question<span class='line-break'> </span>of its improvement was brought before the Board as <span class='line-break'> </span>follows.</p>
<p>"Mr Cheever having made a statement that the<span class='line-break'> </span>"City of Cambridge contemplated the improvement of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Need of Coolidge Avenue, it was<span class='line-break'> </span>Noted that  [illegible] Cheever  and  [illegible] be a committee<span class='line-break'> </span>to arrange with the City of Cambridge for the payment <span class='line-break'> </span>Of $250 by this corporationWhen paying grading shall have<span class='line-break'> </span>Been contemplated to that satisfaction of the committee.</p>
<p>In 1869 the grading was completed which has caused<span class='line-break'> </span>the injuries complained.</p>
<p>The grade of the sidewalk at the entrance to Mr.<span class='line-break'> </span>Muzzey Estate ( then owned by Mr Lawrence) was reduced<span class='line-break'> </span>about  [illegible] feet, and no support being provided for the <span class='line-break'> </span>wall on the line of the estate, it has since fallen, and besides<span class='line-break'> </span>rebuilding the wall a considerable expense has<span class='line-break'> </span>been incurred in reducing the grade of his roadway to the<span class='line-break'> </span>new grade of the Avenue. A similar but less reduction<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>in grade was made in front of Mr Coolidge's Estate.<span class='line-break'> </span>He claims that a bank wall is necessary in front <span class='line-break'> </span>of his land and that access to his premises has been <span class='line-break'> </span>rendered more difficiult.</p>
<p>Both parties base their claim against this Cor<span class='line-break'></span>poration upon the allegation, that the City of Cam<span class='line-break'></span>bridge in making the changes of grade acted as the <span class='line-break'> </span>licensee or agent of the Corporation as owner of the fee.</p>
<p>If this were the fact the Committee are not prepared<span class='line-break'> </span>to admit that any claim for damages could be main<span class='line-break'></span>tained.  The repairs upon the avenue have improved its <span class='line-break'> </span>condition for travel, and have so far been advantageous <span class='line-break'> </span>to the abuttors.  They must sooner or later have been <span class='line-break'> </span>made.  But the Committee are clearly of opinion that <span class='line-break'> </span>this Corporation did not make the City of Cambridge <span class='line-break'> </span>its agent and is not responsible for its acts.  The vote <span class='line-break'> </span>was simply an agreement to contribute to the expense <span class='line-break'> </span>in case the work was done satisfactorily, to its Committee.</p>
<p>Before the work was completed, complaints were made<span class='line-break'> </span>by Mr Coolidge and it appears from the correspondence<span class='line-break'> </span>on file that the Mayor of Cambridge was distinctly <span class='line-break'> </span>informed by Mr Norcross that the Corporation would <span class='line-break'> </span>not undertake to arrange with Mr Coolidge, would do <span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>On Nov. 9. 1869 after the Coolidge claim had been <span class='line-break'> </span>presented to the Board, it was voted,<span class='line-break'> </span>"That the Treasurer be authorized to pay $250 to the City <span class='line-break'> </span>"of Cambridge, for the improvements made upon Coolidge <span class='line-break'> </span>"Avenue, upon receiving from said City a sufficient <span class='line-break'> </span>"bond of indemnity against any claim for damages <span class='line-break'> </span>"by the abuttors, or a satisfactory release from said<span class='line-break'> </span>"abuttors."</p>
<p>Several demands have since been made for <span class='line-break'> </span>the payment of this money, but the terms of the vote <span class='line-break'> </span>not having been complied with nothing has been <span class='line-break'> </span>paid.
