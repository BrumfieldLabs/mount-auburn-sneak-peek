<p>Mount Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>July 25th 1861.</p>
<p>Sir;</p>
<p>As no reply has been given to<span class='line-break'> </span>my resignation as Gardener at Mt Auburn<span class='line-break'> </span>Cemetery: presented to the Board of Trustees<span class='line-break'> </span>June 1st; I would again tender to<span class='line-break'> </span>these my resignation as Gardener,<span class='line-break'> </span>provided they will refund to me the amount<span class='line-break'> </span>I have paid them, &amp; further agree to turn<span class='line-break'> </span>over to the Corporation all the Lots I have<span class='line-break'> </span>under my care; as my resignation was<span class='line-break'> </span>made in June and I have been put to<span class='line-break'> </span>considerable trouble in the intermediate<span class='line-break'> </span>time. I presume some renumeration<span class='line-break'> </span>will be made to me for the two months;<span class='line-break'> </span>trusting to receive an immediate an<span class='line-break'></span>swer. I remain very Respectfully</p>

<p>The following suggestions may be worthy<span class='line-break'> </span>of some consideration in case the Corporation<span class='line-break'> </span>should deem it advisable to take the matter of<span class='line-break'> </span>Gardening into their own hands;</p>
<p>1st The Cemetery could be divided into Districts,<span class='line-break'> </span>and the care of each given to one, two or three men,<span class='line-break'> </span>according to the size and amount of work kto be done in<span class='line-break'> </span>each District; as each squad of men would know<span class='line-break'> </span>from day to day just what was to be done, and there being<span class='line-break'> </span>no loss of time in transferring men from one<span class='line-break'> </span>part of the grounds to another, the work could<span class='line-break'> </span>be done cheaper than at present; All the work in this<span class='line-break'> </span>department could be under the supervision of a head<span class='line-break'> </span>Gardener, subject to the discretion of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>2d -- I should recommend cultivating only what are<span class='line-break'> </span>called "Bedding Plants," a [list?] can be kept with<span class='line-break'> </span>but little expense during the winter; for this pur<span class='line-break'></span>pose a pit could be built at a small expense to be used<span class='line-break'> </span>intil [sic] about the 1st of Feby, thus saving quite an expense<span class='line-break'> </span>in fact --</p>
<p>3d It might be argued that this system would [consider?]<span class='line-break'> </span>the duties of the Superintendent; but if a competent<span class='line-break'> </span>Gardener was employed he would attend to this<span class='line-break'> </span>duty himself; as a printed schedule of prices could<span class='line-break'> </span>be furnished each Proprietor, approved by the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees; the rivalry between the various parties<span class='line-break'> </span>who have the care of Lots at present would be turned<span class='line-break'> </span>into a different [channel?], that is it would be between<span class='line-break'> </span>the employees of the Corporation<sup>who</sup>have charge of the<span class='line-break'> </span><del>Corporation</del> various Districts to see which would<span class='line-break'> </span>accomplish his or their work the best.<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>4th I would suggest that all [..ait?] made by<span class='line-break'> </span>outside laborers, should be cleared up by them<span class='line-break'></span>selves on the day it is made; thus relieving the Cor<span class='line-break'></span>poration of quite an expense as at present conduc<span class='line-break'></span>ted --</p>
