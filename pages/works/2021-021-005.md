<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I feel much indebted to <span class='line-break'> </span>you for the trouble you have <span class='line-break'> </span>taken in Answering my Enquiries<span class='line-break'> </span>respecting the management of <span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn Cemetery as well <span class='line-break'> </span>as for the  Catalogue which contains <span class='line-break'> </span>much useful information. There <span class='line-break'> </span>are many hints contained in your <span class='line-break'> </span>letter which will prove extremely <span class='line-break'> </span>valuable to us.

<p>Our Cemetery is not quite a <span class='line-break'> </span>new one, having been established <span class='line-break'> </span>in 1848, but I have held office <span class='line-break'> </span>only during the present year and <span class='line-break'> </span>found many matters requiring<span class='line-break'> </span>systemetizing and amendment <span class='line-break'> </span>to prevent confusion in future <span class='line-break'> </span>years.  The grounds are very<span class='line-break'> </span>prettily situated about 2 1/2 miles <span class='line-break'> </span>from the City and are nearly<span class='line-break'> </span>equal in extend to those Mount <span class='line-break'> </span>Auburn, but as yet a large portion <span class='line-break'> </span>of them remains unimproved<span class='line-break'> </span>though capable of being made<span class='line-break'> </span>[pg 3; right of fold]<span class='line-break'> </span>extremely beautiful;  but in a <span class='line-break'> </span>place such as this, with a <span class='line-break'> </span>comparatively small and <sup>not</sup> very <span class='line-break'> </span>wealthy population it takes <span class='line-break'> </span>a considerable time to effect <span class='line-break'> </span>any costly improvements.  In the <span class='line-break'> </span>mean time we must trust a <span class='line-break'> </span>great deal to what Nature has <span class='line-break'> </span>done for us and endeavor to con<span class='line-break'></span>ine such decorations as are or <span class='line-break'> </span><sup>maybe</sup> made, within the limits of "good <span class='line-break'> </span>taste."</p>
<p>Our Corporation is a [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>Stock Company.  The subscribed<span class='line-break'> </span>Capital being devoted to the pur<span class='line-break'></span>chase of the ground, and repaid<span class='line-break'> </span>to the Stockholders from Sales of Lots</p>
