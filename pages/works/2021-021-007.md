<p>THE EYES OF GOD.</p>
<p>BY REV. J.C. RYLE, B.A.</p>
<p>Think of the eyes of God. They are everywhere. In <span class='line-break'> </span>every house, in every field, in every room, in every com<span class='line-break'></span>pany, -- alone or in a crowd, -- the eyes of God are always<span class='line-break'> </span>upon you. "The eyes of the Lord are in every place,<span class='line-break'> </span>beholding the evil and the good," (PROV. XV:3,) and they<span class='line-break'> </span>are eyes that read hearts as well as actions.</p>
<p>Endeavor, I beseech you, to remember this. Recollect<span class='line-break'> </span>that you have to do with an all-seeing God, -- a God who<span class='line-break'> </span>never slumbereth nor sleepeth, -- a God who understands your<span class='line-break'> </span>thoughts afar off, and with whom the night shines as the day. You may<span class='line-break'> </span>lock the door, -- you may draw down the blind, -- you may shut the shutters,<span class='line-break'> </span>-- you may put out the candle; -- it makes no difference. God sees you.<span class='line-break'> </span>God is everywhere. You may go away like the prodigal, into a far country,<span class='line-break'> </span>and think that there is nobody to watch your conduct; but the eye and ear of<span class='line-break'> </span>God are there before you. You may deceive your parents or employers, --<span class='line-break'> </span>you may tell them falsehoods, and be one thing before their faces, and another<span class='line-break'> </span>behind their backs, -- but you cannot deceive God. He knows you through<span class='line-break'> </span>and through. He heard what you said to-day. He knows what you are<span class='line-break'> </span>thinking of at this minute. He has set your most secret sins in the light of<span class='line-break'> </span>His countenance, and they will one day come out before the world to your<span class='line-break'> </span>shame, except you take heed.</p>
<p>Reader, live as in the sight of God. This is what Abraham did, -- he<span class='line-break'> </span>walked before Him. This is what Enoch did, -- he walked with Him. This is<span class='line-break'> </span>what heaven itself will be, -- the eternal presence of God. Do nothing you<span class='line-break'> </span>would not like God to see. Say nothing you would not like God to hear.<span class='line-break'> </span>Write nothing you would not like God to read. Go to no place where you<span class='line-break'> </span>would not like God to find you. Read no book of which you would not like<span class='line-break'> </span>God to say, "Show it me." Never spend your time in such a way that you<span class='line-break'> </span>would not like to have God say, "What art thou doing?"</p>
<p>Reader, I advise you to study the 139th Psalm, and learn it by heart.</p>
<p>The blood of Jesus Christ, His<span class='line-break'> </span>Son, cleanseth us from all sin.<span class='line-break'> </span>1 John 1:7.</p>
<p>21 Bowdoin Street,<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, Nov 4th 1864</p>
<p>A.J. Coolidge Esq.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have been<span class='line-break'> </span>unable to make any inquiry about a<span class='line-break'> </span>Lot in other cemeteries. Of course my<span class='line-break'> </span>preference is for Mt Auburn and if<span class='line-break'> </span>you are willing I would be pleased<span class='line-break'> </span>to have you make a statement of<span class='line-break'> </span>the case to the board on Monday<span class='line-break'> </span>and ask them what they will sell for<span class='line-break'> </span>under the circumstances, a portion of<span class='line-break'> </span>"St Matthews" lot as we portioned out<span class='line-break'> </span>yesterday. If you feel to use your<span class='line-break'> </span>influence to get the price reduced for<span class='line-break'> </span>the [cu..?] sake, I shall feel very<span class='line-break'> </span>grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfull yours</p>
<p>Chs. Cullis</p>
