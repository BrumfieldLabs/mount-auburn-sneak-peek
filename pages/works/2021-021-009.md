<p>Dear [?]<span class='line-break'> </span>Will you please reply to this note<span class='line-break'> </span>in place of  <span class='line-break'> </span>[?]<span class='line-break'> </span>C. P. Cutis</p>
<p>[Letter below]</p>
<p>C: P: Curtis, Esquire<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston. Mass:</p>
<p>I take the liberty to write to you,<span class='line-break'> </span>Sir! finding your name in a list of the trustees of the <span class='line-break'> </span>Mount Auburn Cemetery and feeling that there is something <span class='line-break'> </span>so national in your name as to invite [?] a<span class='line-break'> </span>stranger, for the purpose of making some inquiries about <span class='line-break'> </span>your institution with a view to the better government of a <span class='line-break'> </span>similar institution over which I preside.  I will not ask <span class='line-break'> </span>you to trouble yourself personally about these queries, farther<span class='line-break'> </span>that to give them the necessary directions to some superin<span class='line-break'></span>endent or other officer and to request him to answer them.</p>
<p>I. At what rates, by the square <span class='line-break'> </span>foot, are lots sold?  lowest and highest prices?</p>
<p>II. At what rates are graves<span class='line-break'> </span>dug? - stating the size and cost.</p>
<p>III. What does the superintend<span class='line-break'></span>ent think of iron fences for lots - if they be permitted in the <span class='line-break'> </span>cemetery?</p>
<p>IV. What does he think of ever-</p>

<p>-green enclosures for the lots?  Would he think them <span class='line-break'> </span>preferable to iron or stone fences?</p>
<p>V.  What does he think of not al<span class='line-break'></span>lowing either iron or stone fences or evergreen enclosures <span class='line-break'> </span>for the lots, but leaving them all open and concentration <span class='line-break'> </span>all care upon the grass and trees?</p>
<p>VI. Is the cemetery closed on Sun<span class='line-break'></span>days and Holy days?</p>
<p>VII. How are the lots kept in order<span class='line-break'></span>by the company or by the owners? - if by the company, at <span class='line-break'> </span>what charge to the owners?</p>
<p>VIII. Does the company accept <span class='line-break'> </span>the execution of [?Arrests?] to keep lots in good order forever?</p>
<p>I send you herewith a pamphlet <span class='line-break'> </span>descriptive of our Cemetery.  We would wish to make it <span class='line-break'> </span>all that its founder intended it should be, and hence we ap<span class='line-break'></span>proach the older cemeteries, hoping to derive instruction from <span class='line-break'> </span>their greater experience.  We find that our institution, in <span class='line-break'> </span>some matters of taste, is becoming an educational influence <span class='line-break'> </span>of no mean power.  It is our purpose to give it [?] highest <span class='line-break'> </span>development, possible, within the limit of our means.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,<span class='line-break'> </span>J. Pringle Jones.<span class='line-break'> </span>Readng. Penn<sup>a</sup> 5 Nov '66</p>
