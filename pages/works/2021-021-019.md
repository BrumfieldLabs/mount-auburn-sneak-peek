<p>[Letterhead: Mount Auburn Cemetery.<span class='line-break'> </span>16 PEMBERTON SQUARE,<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, Sept 30 1870]</p>
<p>N.B. Mackintosh Esq<span class='line-break'> </span>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>It is even so as you<span class='line-break'> </span>say - much to my mortification and<span class='line-break'> </span>chagrin. Moseley, Coole and<span class='line-break'> </span>Blanchard are on the <u>Gen. Funds</u>,<span class='line-break'> </span>credited with interest inst. of R. F.<span class='line-break'> </span>I cannot conceive how I could<span class='line-break'> </span>have done it, except that it<span class='line-break'> </span>was a thing so palpable it did<span class='line-break'> </span>not require thinking enough. I<span class='line-break'> </span>took great pains to separate them<span class='line-break'> </span>in the files - made two lists of<span class='line-break'> </span>income to be collected, and every<span class='line-break'> </span>way tried to guard against<span class='line-break'> </span>such an error, which I wondered<span class='line-break'> </span>at in my predecesser,<span class='line-break'> </span>but all in vain.</p>
<p>The lesson I trust you will</p>

<p>draw from the errors of all your<span class='line-break'> </span>predecessors - "to take nothing for<span class='line-break'> </span>granted, ^ <sup>even</sup> if you think it is right<span class='line-break'> </span>in your mind's eye." I think most<span class='line-break'> </span>of our errors are of the kind that<span class='line-break'> </span>we miss the most obvious things.</p>
<p>I think I would advise you<span class='line-break'> </span>to carry it off at the end of your<span class='line-break'> </span>Sept<sup>r</sup> cash to the Repair Fund<span class='line-break'> </span>book, by a charge <u>per contra</u> in<span class='line-break'> </span>last column of cash.</p>
<p>I am sorry thus to have been<span class='line-break'> </span>the means of requiring you to<span class='line-break'> </span>make a cross entry, but am<span class='line-break'> </span>glad that it does not come<span class='line-break'> </span>into your laber &amp; materials, or expense<span class='line-break'> </span>column. It of course will have to<span class='line-break'> </span>be posted to the debit of income<span class='line-break'> </span>[etc?] in the [?] of [?], so<span class='line-break'> </span>as to correct amt. of income<span class='line-break'> </span>to go into report at end of year.</p>
<p>Yours truly<span class='line-break'> </span>A. J. Coolidge</p>
