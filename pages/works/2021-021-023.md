<p>Mount Auburn Cemetery.<span class='line-break'> </span>16 PEMBERTON SQUARE.<span class='line-break'> </span>Boston, Feby 8th 1869</p>
<p>Gentlemen: --</p>
<p>When I was chosen Treasurer, I was<span class='line-break'> </span>asked to state what compensation I expected. I under<span class='line-break'></span>took it last year for the same salary that Mr<span class='line-break'> </span>Bond had received -- $1.000. --</p>
<p>I have since ascertained that Mr Bond had<span class='line-break'> </span>been in the habit, from year to year, of paying<span class='line-break'> </span>a collector five per cent on the amount of gardening<span class='line-break'> </span>bills collected by him -- not out of the $1000, but<span class='line-break'> </span>from the moneys collected. The gardening bills of last<span class='line-break'> </span>year amount to more than $8.000. If they ranged<span class='line-break'> </span>in Mr Bond's time from $6.000 to $8.000, that would have<span class='line-break'> </span>added from $300 to $400 to the am<sup><sup>t</sup></sup> of salary.</p>
<p>I have paid no collector to canvass, believing<span class='line-break'> </span>it better to get the proprietors into the habit of paying<span class='line-break'> </span>at the office, and I hope to avoid sending out a<span class='line-break'> </span>drummer, to any extent.</p>
<p>After assuming the duties, and receiving the<span class='line-break'> </span>books of my predecessor, I soon found that a larger<span class='line-break'> </span>accumulation of his work was left for me to finish.<span class='line-break'> </span>My work, the last year, was doubled, in consequence.<span class='line-break'> </span>I had expected to save perhaps a quarter or more of the<span class='line-break'> </span>salary thus voted, for the increased personal labor and<span class='line-break'> </span>responsibility: but I was at once required to employ</p>

<p>a first class bookkeeper, and it was then supposed that<span class='line-break'> </span>a portion of his time might be devoted to other pursuits.</p>
<p>So far, however, was such course from the line of<span class='line-break'> </span>possibility, that I have found the labors of the office have not<span class='line-break'> </span>only required the whole time of myself and Mr Barbour,<span class='line-break'> </span>but have compelled us to work often into the night.</p>
<p>Immediately I saw the situation, and told Mr Barbour<span class='line-break'> </span>he should have the $1000, and he has received every dollar<span class='line-break'> </span>of my salary as Treasurer. Besides this I have hired<span class='line-break'> </span>extra help, which I found necessary to hasten the work<span class='line-break'> </span>of collecting, amounting to some $175.00.</p>
<p>We have collected more than $5.000 of the old<span class='line-break'> </span>accounts -- some of them almost hopeless -- and thus<span class='line-break'> </span>the effort has been a paying one. There remains a<span class='line-break'> </span>considerable sum to be collected.</p>
<p>I think an additional allowance should be<span class='line-break'> </span>made me for the last year's work, and trust this<span class='line-break'> </span>view will meet the approbation of the Trustees.</p>
<p>As to the future: --</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated to<span class='line-break'> </span>my mind that the duties of Secretary and<span class='line-break'> </span>Treasurer cannot be properly performed<span class='line-break'> </span>for the amount of money now paid. The business<span class='line-break'> </span>is one of extensive detail, and with the most<span class='line-break'> </span>of method that can be brought to its exe<span class='line-break'></span>cution -- even when the present outstanding accounts<span class='line-break'> </span>shall have been adjusted -- will require the<span class='line-break'> </span>whole time of the incumbent and a bookkeeper.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible, it seems to me, for even<span class='line-break'> </span>those who are best acquainted with the business from<span class='line-break'> </span><u>observation</u> to have a full view of the extent and<span class='line-break'> </span>variety of detail.</p>
<p>It seems to have been assumed heretofore, that<span class='line-break'> </span>I was liable to devote a portion of my time to the<span class='line-break'> </span>interests of the Corporation, and a portion to pro<span class='line-break'></span>fessional duties outside. What little of truth there<span class='line-break'> </span>may have been in such assumption heretofore,<span class='line-break'> </span>has now essentially vanished, and I can<span class='line-break'> </span>have <u>no</u> expectation of deriving income from<span class='line-break'> </span>that source -- for I have no time for it.</p>
<p>But I believe that most of the<span class='line-break'> </span>Trustees have had opportunity, of late,<span class='line-break'> </span>to judge of this matter; and I therefore <span class='line-break'> </span>commend it to their attention.</p>
<p>I am Respectfully<span class='line-break'> </span>Your Ob<sup>t</sup> Serv<sup>t</sup></p>
