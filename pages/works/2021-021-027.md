<p>1414 Park Ave. Baltimore Md.<span class='line-break'> </span>Jan 4/1911.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: --</p>
<p>Referring to attached blanks received from<span class='line-break'> </span>you today, if these are not filled out correctly,<span class='line-break'> </span>please send me another set with a statement<span class='line-break'> </span>as to the errors in enclosed set.</p>
<p>In order that you may have the full facts in<span class='line-break'> </span>the case, the following information is presented to you: --</p>
<p>My father, John S. March, left a will in which<span class='line-break'> </span>a specific bequest was made to me, and the residue<span class='line-break'> </span>to my mother Caroline S. March who was named<span class='line-break'> </span>in the will as executrix. She died on Feb 2, 1910<span class='line-break'> </span>and was buried in the lot on Feb 6th 1910.<span class='line-break'> </span>She left no will, so that her property went<span class='line-break'> </span>to my father and myself. He was appointed<span class='line-break'> </span>administrator of her estate, but on account of<span class='line-break'> </span>illness never closed up same, so that since<span class='line-break'> </span>his death, I have had to take out new<span class='line-break'> </span>administration papers on her estate, as well<span class='line-break'> </span></p>

<p>as papers on his estate. I expect to close both estates<span class='line-break'> </span>up in a comparatively short time; and in doing so<span class='line-break'> </span>I thought I would like to have this lot deeded<span class='line-break'> </span>over to me, unless there is no advantage in same.<span class='line-break'> </span>On this point, I should be glad to hear from<span class='line-break'> </span>you. Also please advise what procedure on my<span class='line-break'> </span>part is necessary to fix matters so that<span class='line-break'> </span>somebody can sign for me in case of my<span class='line-break'> </span>death.</p>
