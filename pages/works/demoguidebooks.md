<p>In relation to the price<span class='line-break'> </span>according to Mr. Spears account<span class='line-break'> </span>there was an alteration.</p>

<p>Subject: Boston Fire.</p>
<p>Mount Auburn Wednesday<span class='line-break'> </span>March 19, 19th 1873</p>
<p>Colonel Folsom</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>I went this day to the<span class='line-break'> </span>office of Messrs Russell and<span class='line-break'> </span>Richardson to make inquiry<span class='line-break'> </span>in relation to Mount Auburn <span class='line-break'> </span>Guides.</p>
<p>The balance<span class='line-break'> </span>of their last edition was destroyed<span class='line-break'> </span>by the Boston fire on the 9th of<span class='line-break'> </span>November last. In relation<span class='line-break'> </span>to a new edition I found them<span class='line-break'> </span>undecided, they say they have as<span class='line-break'> </span>much business on hand as they<span class='line-break'> </span>can attend to properly and would<span class='line-break'> </span>be glad to sell out. The plates<span class='line-break'> </span>were at the printers office and<span class='line-break'> </span>were saved. I regard it as very<span class='line-break'> </span>uncertain whether or not they<span class='line-break'> </span>will publish a new edition this<span class='line-break'> </span>Spring</p>
